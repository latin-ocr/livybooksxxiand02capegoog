seems to point to an entirely different route from that which
has been traced above. After speaking of the civil striis among
⁶ the natives of the Island, and then of the supplies furnished to
«Hannibal in return for his decisivo succour, he makes him
turn ad loevam in his way towards the Alps. Of the various
explanatione offered of this p,hrase two only give a likely

the banks of the river Dromo. The other view leaves the bun<
⁴of the army on the' South of the Isere, while a detachment only
erosses to decide the civil war, which done, the whole oon-
tinues on its march along the Eastern or left bank up to
Grenoble. But the latter version can make little of *the words
in Tricastinos flexit which are coupled with ad laevam, for
the Tricastini lay further to the South, and their chief town,
called afterwards ‘Auqmta Tricastinorum,’ may be most pro-
bably identified with Aoste on the Dromo, though by some
placed lower down near ⁸ St Paul trois chateaux’ upon the

’ Rhene. The advocates therefore of the march up the Isere,

assume that the words in question have slipped out of their
proper place in a passage which describes the march up the
river towards the Island. Accepting the earlier explanation
- we may follow the traek described by Livy along the Drome up Α
to Aoste‚ and thence to Die, which stands for Dea Vocontiorum,
⁴ a powerful tribe here mentioned by him, whose northern bor-
ders reached up to the Isere and the Drac, while their frontier
on the South-East extended far along the road to Gap and to
Embrun‚.through which country Hannibal may 'have led his
troops, skirting the lands of the Tricorii who were spread to
the North-West. He would thus have reached the Durance,
the Druentia of Livy, and have made his way to Briancmm, and
across the Mont Genevre, known to the Romans of the time of
Oaesar as the Alpes Juziae, though afterwards called Cottion,
after the native chieftain who did so much to improve the
mountain 'roads about him to win the favour of Augustus.
It would seem to have been the same route, though in a con-
trary directim, which Julius Caesar followed in his march into
Transalpina Gaul, as indicated in the words ‘ab Ocel0, quod
est citerioris provincioe extremum, in fines Vocontiorum ulteri-
oris provinciae die septimo pervenit5 inde in Allobroyumfines!

Β. G. 1. 10. 5. It 18 the same track also m the main by which
Livy v. 34 brings Bellovesus with his Gallie hordes through
the Tricastini, and the Taurini Saltus into the plains of Lom-
bardywhere th⁹ey settled, at the end of the regal period of Rome.

From the Island to the ascent itself, the narratives of Livy

and Polybius have no points in common, the local names
furnished by the former being entirely absent in the latter,
while the other conditions of the march are quite distinct.
