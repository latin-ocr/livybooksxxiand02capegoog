268 Nom& ΧΧΙῙΙ. ο. mn. §e-c.1x1v. §10-

ς 6. pondo Una et selibras, cf. xxr. 62. 8, and Varro de
Ling- Lat. Π. 40, Se valet dimidium ut in selibra, semodio.

ς 7. naepe iactam, ‘after nequent debete)
g 8. quomam, dcc„ explains the following tardius er.
erog-aretur. The technical term for a vote of the supplies.

Ρ, 102 g 10. praesidio. A participle like futui-'uis is here
needed to balance circumspectans.

necunde, cf. note on 2. 3.

c. xxrv. ἓ 4. quod, minime... Polybius explains more
fully the policy of H. who was anxious to winter at Gereonium,
and to gether in supplies from all the country round before
the Romans could interfere. This accounts for the large
numbers (duas exercitus partes 23. 10) sent out to forage. He
recalled indeed part of them at first, when the two campe were
pitched so near each other, but ventured at last to send them
out again, as he was anxious to gain large reserves of fodder
for the horseS, in which his strength lay. The scene and the
details are much better described by the Greek writer.

ἓ 5. conspectum. See note on 4. 6.

ξ 6. proprior. To be taken with Romanorum eastra, un-
derstood in what follows, ei with apparuit.

5 7. paucitate, i. e. 2000 Polyb.

ς 8. [Tum ut]. If these are expunged, the rest makes
good sense. W. reads tum utique, which is harsh, though it
may be supported by tum utique immodice oi 27. 2.

Ρ, 103, per aversa a casn-is... Madvig’s correction for
per av. castra e castris oi the MSS. W. suggests per a. c. ne
conspici posset e castris H.. but all this is already implied in the
text, which is much simpler‚ and aversa castra is an unnatural
Ἠῖὲῗξέἑὲἱξὲᾀὲᾶὲοῗ. 5¹22 ἓξὲξ 32²5& ζεῖ ffissssffli’ssssz'
The phrases per aversa urbis, v· 29. 1, or aversis collibus, xxvn.
41. 6, do not seem to justify the use oi aversa castra in this
sense.

ξ 9. This section has been rearranged by Madvig, as the
MSS. seem here, as often in this book, to have lost some

words out of their text.

ς 10. receperat suos. Polyb. mentions that Hasdrubal

bad covered the retreat of many of the foragers to the camp
at Gereonium, to which H. afterwards retired.
