they were sent forth in search oi some new homes, and that
guided on their several paths by animals sacred to the Italian
Mars, they made their way into Samnium and Picenum, and
to other lands, where they accepted henceforth as their
national symbols, the bul] in Samnium, the woodpecker (picum)
in Picenum, and the wolf for the Hirpini, whose forefathers
had been led by it to their new homes. In the ease above re-
ferred to the senate gave its sanction to the voW, but the Chief
Pontiff was aware that ancient usage required the consent of
the whole people‚ and a bill was drawn up by his instructions,
