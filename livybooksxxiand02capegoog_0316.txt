at last took to swimming) and drew the whole herd after it,
and that as each grew frightened at the depth and lost its foot-
hold, the force of the current swept it to the opposite bank?
The construction and the thought seem equally confused,

a simple fact occurs chiefly in later writers as Tac. Hist. Π. 35,
ἴὲρηαιανη...ἀοηεο proelium nox dirimeret. But it may possibly
