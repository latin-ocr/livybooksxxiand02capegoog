of the early Empire show this spelling, but nouns
of the second decl. in ius, ium were written in the
Republie with one ἰ only ιιι the qen. as imperi,· adjec-

' tives assumed the double i earlier, and gradually a

like rule spread to the nouus·
K. O. Originally the letter Ο corresponded to our

G sound, as in the O which stands for Gaius, till
Spurius Carvilius introduced the letter G, and O
then took the place of the tenuis K.

01, TI, were often confused in common speech,
inscriptions, and MSS„ but in the following words
the right reading seems quite established: σωιώἰοίο,
conch, cowvitium, dicio, mutim, nuntius, otium, setius,
solacium, suspitio (Fleckeisen, Fimfziq Art).

QVO. CV. QVV. The old form quom became

cum in the time of J. Caesar, there being little
evidence for quum in the first century. So quoi

passed into cui and qum-e into οων. Secundus is

early found for sequendus. AE'quom became omma,
then later on oeqmmn.

N in old Latin was often omitted before i and
s, as in cojmaae, cosol, cosor, Meyalea‘a ,· but in the
final ens of the numerals it was retained till the
end of the Augustan era, though afterwards confined
to totiens, quotiem, and the like.

. S S, frequent at the end of the Republic, was
changed to ες thus Cicero used caussa, divissione& but
later inscriptions aster the 'Monumentum Ancyranum
have a single s.
