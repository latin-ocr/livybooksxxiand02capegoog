fondly recurred to the old models of archaic diction,
and the accomplished Emperor Hadrian, who set up
for a literary critic, avowed his preference of Ooelius

Republic, for Brutus took the trouble to compress
them into shorter form, and Cicero asks Atticus to

(Epitomen Bruti ‘Oaeliwnorum Cic. ad Act. xm. 8).
His history of the Punic war was singled out for

and in this we are told that he followed Silenus very
closely (Cic. de divin. 1. 24). In the third decade

the same battle. There are a few words quoted from
