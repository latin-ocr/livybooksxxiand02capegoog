warde 1110 government oi Sicily fell to his lot as Praetor, and
there is reason to believe that he endeared himself to the

have risked probable disaster, irem which he was saved only
by the steady valour of the legionarios and the forethought ot

Τ110 resentment of the nobles was intense, and they forced
a dictator to resign, who had been bold enough to name
Flaminius as his Master of the Horse. But it is to the credit
of the latter, that in his censorship of 219 he did not stoop to
