170 NOTES. XXI. e. 111. 54-0. 1111. 53.

gical blunder, by which the tentare from tentus, tendere was
assimilated to the temptas from temnere, in which the p was
inserted for euphony between m and π.

Hispanum. Either generally, or in distinction to the
Saguntinos who were said to be of foreign race.

movebant. Fabri remarks on the frequent use of the
imperf. with' postquam, in cases where the action is supposed
still to continue. Cf. 111. 60. 8, postquam jam multa dies erat,
neque movebatur quicquam.

condiclones. ‘ Harsh conditione were named as might be
expected from an implacable enemy! 'I'his spelling of con·
dicio is almost invariably found in the best MSS. and inscrip-
tions3 the derivation from condere must therefore be given up
in favour of that which connects it with dicio, judicare, δίκη,
and the root dile. On the use of ut, cf. 7. 7.

massua-a ex or. ‘Tm-ned deserter instead of advocate?

sub condic. The sub is very rarely used in this connexion,

- publice 8. ‘Recognized by the State of Saguntum as,’ &c. ·

το) This sense suits most of the passages in which the
phrase is used in Livy, but in some it can only refer to a
special meeting convened for the purpose, as in mn 21. 1,
where the praetor calls the senate together to discuss the
claims of an applicant for a triumph. So too of the corres-
ponding expressions, mn. ’7. 11, senatum extemplo postulat,
where the demand is for a special meeting.

c. 1111. 51. veni. The subi. venissem of the MSS. here
seems out of place in reference to the definite hoc iter, and
Madvig reads veni. sed, thinking that this was written veni
set, then changed to venisset, and afterwards as a mistake in
the person to venissem.

g 2. pro. ‘In the name of,' ‘ out of regard for.’

g 3. loqui, quoe loquor. A sort of repetition constantly
occurring in Latin writers. Fabri compares Quintil. 11. 3. 80,
accedit et ex illa figura qratia, qua nomina dixi mutatis casibus
repeti ‘ non minus cederet quam cessit?
