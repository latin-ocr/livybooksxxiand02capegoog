ROUTE OF HANNIBAL. 315

Barmette in one account, or the rock 01 Baune according to

another, and there are dangerous spots in the descent where -

7. One argument indeed hm been insisted on, that here
alone could a point of view be found upon the summit, com·
manding an extensive prospect 01 the Italian plain, such as
that which Hannibal 13 said to have had before him, when he
tried to revive the drooping courage 01 1113 soldiers. The spot
in question is not however on the road itseli‚ but on a ridge
which was little likely to have tempted the weary men to need-
less efforts through the snow 101· the sake 01 a fine view. Nor
was the actual prospect 01 importance for the general’s appeal.
The phrase 01 Polybius on which stress has been laid (ἐναργ εισι)

more probably refers to the moral weight of evidence that Italy ,

{vass Wissssm easy reach, than to any actual picture stretched out
0 ore t e ey 03.

The language 01 Livy’ 13 too definite indeed to be mistaken,
in promontorio quodam, ubi· lonye ac late prospectus erat,
consistere jussis militibus Italiam ostentat....xxr. 35. 7. But
we must remember that Livy had little knowledge 01 the Alps3
that he may easily have given a different colouring to the
account 01 the general’s address which he found in the old
annalists3 and that he was thinking more 01 rhetorical effect
than 01 strict accuracy 01 local statements.

The three passes hitherto described are very far from being
all 01 those whose rival claims have been supported. . Almost
every height which could possibly be crossed, and some indeed
that are quite impassable 101· any but practised mountaineers,
have been at some time advocated as the pass of Hannibal.
Some routes have been disposed 01 by a fuller knowledge 01 the
rugged country which lies between the Drac‚ the Romanche‚
and the Duranoe, and which until lately was almost unex-
plored, and ill described upon the mapS. Some hopelessly
conflict with the main data 01 the ancient authors, and the
books or pamphlets written in their defence are only monu-
ments 01 misplaced ingenuity and learning. None of these
seems now to call for serious discussion.

It should be stated in conclusion that the claims 01 the
Little St Bernard, or the Graian Alps, to be the ‘pass intended
by Polybius were recognized by General Melville in 177 5 whose
view was expanded by M. de Luc in 1818. Messrs Cramer
and Wickham in the Dissertation 01 1820 supported the same
theory, and Mr Law in his masterly work upon the subject
seems to have proved decisively that the evidence points to that
conclusion, while Livy’s pass must be the Mont Genevre.
Niebuhr and Mommsen have accepted the authority 01 Poly-
bins in favour 01 the Graian Alps.
