5 3. et, ut cuiusque. 'I'he MSS. have no ut, but it seems to
be required, and may have been omitted after the et, from the
similarity of the words. W. notes that only one pair of com·-
batants is mentioned by Polyb„ and thinks that therefore the
et cujus of some MSS. is better, but the vincentium of the last
line points to several pairs fighting together.

exciderat. So ὁ κλῆρος ἐκπίπτει. cf. mn. 3. 7, nominibus
iu tegnam conjectis citari, quod primum sorte nomm excidit,

the ceremonial dances of the Romans, as of the Salii, cum
tripudiis solemnique cantu, 1. 20. 3, and of the Fratres Arvales
in the inscriptions.

5 4. habentes. The MSS. have habentibus, and W. retains
it, but it seems equally awkward to regard it with Fabri as an
abl. abs„ or as dative agreeing with vobis while understanding
