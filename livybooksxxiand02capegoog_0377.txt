adverso sen. ⁸ In the teeth of the senate ς’ though the
sanction of the senate was not constitutionally necessary, it
was scarcely ever ignored.

This law may have been popular (v. savorem apud plebem)
with the people generally, from the barbarous prejudice
against trade which had been so largely 'shared b the old
raees of the West, and which made it seem discredita le to the
governing classes. The immediate cause may have been to
prevent the ruling families from abusing their power in the
provinces to enrich themselves and their friends by com·
mercial speculatione, supported by all the powers of the
government. The prohibition therefore extended to the sons
of· the senators, or to the class as a whole. But it was also
popular with the middle class, which thus escaped the com.
petition of the wealthiest families in speculation. The law
was at once a cause, and an effect of the growing power of a
moneyed aristocraoy, which was afterwards known as the
ordo equester. Cicero afterwards speaks ot this regulation as
obsolete, Verr. v. 18. 45, antiqua suut ἰδίω δορα et mortuae qua
vetant (aedificare navem senatorem).

ἕ 5. auspiciis ement. cf. x. 40. 4, Pullariae auspicium men·

abused tor political objects, that statesmen ceased to regard it
as anything but an engine of statecraft.

’ latin. feriarum. This ancient festival dated from the days
when Rome was a member of the Latin league, and the highest
magistrates of the various towns (ἅπασα ἡ συναρχίαι, Strabo) went
in solemn procession to the temple of Jupiter Latiam on the
Alban mount. This was kept up ior eges, and more days
were added to commemorate the reconciliation of Plebs and
Patres. The consuls were expected to offer the sacrifices, and

one of their first duties was concipere fer. Lat„ or to fix a time
for the great festival.

‚ ἓ 7. inauspicato. It was held to be the duty οἰ the general
on the day of his leaving Rome for the wars to go up to tho
Capitol to take the auspices at daybreak. After the votorum
nuncupatio he put on the short purple paludamentum (other-
wise sagum or chlamys), and was escorted by his friends be-
yond the gates. Aa bellum cum exit imperator ac lictores
