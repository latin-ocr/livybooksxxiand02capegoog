304 Nom& xxm. ο. ιχ. §3 5-26,

P. 144, 9 5. ¹1⁹. Earinus Torquatus. Descended from an
anoestor of like praenomen and nomen, whose title of Torquatus
is explained by Livy, vn. 10, as derived from the eollar (torques)
oi the Gaul whom he sleW. “

511. si, ut...sl‚ ut. In both eases Madvig has eorreeted
the sieut of the MSS. which gives an awkward turn to the
sentence. He notes a similar mistake in the MSS. in vn. 13. 8
and xxx1v. 2·.⁷· as also Tae. Hist. 1. 83, sicubi for si ubi.

Ρ. Demus, no. 340 near Saticula. cf. vn. 34.

P. 145. calpurnius namma in nu. 258 near Camarina.

515. deminuti...eap1te. The eaput comprised the sum
oi the rights implied in personal ireedom, civil and iamily
status, and change in any of these respeets might bring a
deminutio capitis with it. The forfaiture of freedom was oi
oourse the worst or dem. maxima. In the ease of those who
had given themselves up with arms in their hands it oould not
be recovered easily by the forms of postliminium

abalienato. Madvig's eorreetion for abalienati οἱ the MSS.
Livy uses the word elsewhere either absolutely or with a pm-
position. It would seem natural to say abalienari ab aliqua
re, in the sense of being estranged from a place or putauit,
but not from a right (jure).

5 17. eonati sunt, nl elliptieally put ior ⁸ and might have
sueeeeded if: ἅο.

Ρ, 146 =8320. nam ⁴ fortes ’ elliptieally implies the reason

Jhgr bffi'ffedemque was said instead oi the usual combination
or ee ε.

521. favisse. The MSS. read fuisse ut, which is evi-
dently corrupt. W. eorreets it to fuisse usui which sounds ill
and is somewhat weak, while Madvig’e suggestion is spirited
and balanees invidere in the next line. .

ς 24. ante secundam h„ i. e. aiter sum-ise.

g 25. Haeo vobis. ‘ This, mark you‚’ ὣο. cf. Hor. Epist.
, ἷίιὲ.ἀ1ιῗέυἳίιὶᾐὴτέιέίιὲ Celsus ayit? It is eaned by grammarians

5 26. Et vos. Most MSS. have quos, whieh probably*
grew out of the abbreviation for et and uos.

etis inserted by Madvig to avoid an awkward asyndeton
whieh sounde ill after cunct. ae manetis. ·
