312 APPENDIX I. ’

Βιιι in the description of the pass itsels, in the struggles with
the mountaineers, in the measurements oi time, and in the
accounts of the dangerous point oi the desoent where the road
was swept away, there is often very olose agreement in the
language oi the two, though Livy adds a few details such as
those of the use oi vinegar- and fire to clear a passage sagethrough
the rocks. 'l'he incidents, however, whioh they have in oom-

Livyhas brought the Garthaginians to the plains oi Italy, he
pauses to notiee the different opinions whieh were staoed, yand
give his reasons ἔοι· the route whioh he had traoed. The
Poenino Alps, the great St Romal-d, seems to have been oom-
monly regarded as grthe pass of Hannibal, and stress was laid
on a false derivation oi the word, as ii it oame from Poenus.1t
was enough, he thou g,ht to urge in answer that Germanis tribes
held the entrance to gthis pass, and there oould have been no ‚
motivo to bravo the stout resistanee which they would probably
have offered. The earlier writer Gaelius Antipater, whose work
on the Punio wars was largely used by Livy, brought the in·
vaders through ‘Cremonis Juymnss a mountain unknown to
other authors, but which may remind us in its sound of the
Oramont, and at any rate closely eorresponds to the Little
St Bernard‚ ealled the Graian Alps by Roman writers, But
this leads into the Italian Val d' Aosta, the upper part of whieh

from the mountains through the tribe of the Taurini, with
whom he first oame into hostile eontaot. The Roman historian
admits that there was no sure evidence before him, and that he
relies mainly on tradition3 the aeeount of Polybius he did not
notioe. Βιιι tradition in this matter was aguide of little
value. From the time when Scipio found himself too late
upon the Bhone, till he faoed his enemy on the Τι’σίηω, the
Roman government had entirely lost sight of the Carthaginian
leader. The oountry through whieh he passed was quite un-
known to them, and no trustworthy iniormation could be for-
warded to Rome, or lodged in the offioial arohives. 'l'he Gallio
mountaineers remained long unsubdued‚ and the eventful
tramp oi many a later army eflaeed from their minds the
memory oi they maroh oi Hannibal. 'l'he pop pular legend of
two eenturies later was hardly likely to be aoourate in suoh
details. It was known indeedy that the Tam-im· were attaoked
before the eollision with the legions, and it was natural to sup·
pose that th denied him passage when he moved along their
valley, thoug Polybius tells us that he reeruited first his
