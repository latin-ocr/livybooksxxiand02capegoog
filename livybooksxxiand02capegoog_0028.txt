power of Egypt, bringing together the scattered ele-
ments of tin and copper to be combined by the in-

dustrial arts of the early age of bronze. The course
of these Phoenician adventurers was directed almost
wholly by the interests of trade, but on the N orthern
coast of Africa. their colonies assumed another cha-
racter. There were indeed some early settlements
from Sidon on the shore, as at Hippo and at (lambe,
but these were probably of little note, till larger
streams of immigrants appeared, wh0, unlike the rest,
betook themselves to the interior, and liyed an agri-
cultural life. There is reason to believe that they
,were Oanaanites from the inland, dispossessed perhaps
by Israel under J oshua from the country on the North
of Palestine, and guided from the ports of Sidon to
their new homes by pilots already familiar with 'the
country. Here they may have found some kindred
races, peoples of the Hittite stoek, who had spread
from Egypt in the period known as that of the in-
vasion of the Shepherd dynasties. The new comers
mingled with the native Libyans, and from their
union in the course of ages grew the numerous popu-
lations found in later times in· Zeugitana and Byza-
cene‚ and known as a mixed race' by the name of
Liby-phoenicians.

When Sidon fell before a. sudden onset of the
Philistines in nc, 1209, Tyre stepped into her place, as
the chief power of the Phoenician league, which took
up henceforth a more decided policy in the far West.
