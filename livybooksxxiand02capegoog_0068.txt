“ Livy's tastes; ⁸the critical standard of the agev didnot
require such· labour at his hands3 the reading public
had not such severe historio canone, and much pre-
ferred a piece of fine writing to proof of antiquar-ian
research, and Livy naturally enough catered for the
litei-ary appetitos which he found around him. The
work which he had set himself to ,do seemed great
enough, and left him little leisure to eift and to com-
pare3 the history of seven centur-ies stretched out
before him, and he hurried on to rear his noble
monument to the memory of the Great Republic.

In this way may be probably explained both the
features of agreement and of difference between Poly-
bius and Livy, by supposing that some of the same
sources may be traced in both, from which the former

drew directly, while the latter used them as he found
* thom worked up already in the narrative of one who
was almost a contemporary of the Greek writer. The
theory itself is worthy of acceptance‚ even if we do
not lay much stress upon the evidence which seems ιο
point to Silenus as the ‘common authority, of both
alike, and to Caelius as = the compiler of the Roman
version of the story. It is chiefly in the earlier books
that the probability of this is strongest 3 later in the
decade other influences seem to have come prominently
foi-ward, among which may 'be mentioned memoirs
current in the Scipionic circle, native traditione or
chronicles of Africa, such as those consulted by King
J uba, and works of a later and diffuser style like those
of Valerius Antias. “
