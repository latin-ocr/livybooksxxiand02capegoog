the Decii, and m the elaborate formula quoted by Livy v111.9.
5, point to an early sacrifice oi human victims. The ancient

usage of the ver sacrum has probably a like bearing. A few
years before there had been a similar case in the Gallio war.
'I'he language of Pliny unp lies that the victims bore a repre·
sentative character, as did the Decii in their devotion for
Rome. Pliny N. Η. 38. 2, Boario vero in soro Groecum Groe-

eamque defossos aut aliarum nentium, cum quibus tum res esset,
etiam nostra <etas vidit.

ing the Via Latina, and the most important town upon it be·
tween Rome and Capua.

vellentne militare. Hence the name volones applied to
them: according to Macrobius 1. 11. 30 it was not the first
time they had been used.

c. nvm. ς 2. sicut ante ad Trebiam. This was not men-
tioned by Livy at the time, though in 7. 5 it was specified in
the case oi the prisoners at L. Trasimene.
