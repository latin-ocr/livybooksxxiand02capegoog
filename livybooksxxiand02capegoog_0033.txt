country, making husbandry and irrigation matters
of scientific study, so that even the Roman senate
in a later age thought her books on agriculture
worthy of translation. Abroad, she guided the streame
of trade to every quarter, now opening up relations
with the heart of Africa by meane of caravans, now
turning to account in Spain the old Phoenician skill
in mining, now with dat-ing enterprise ‘exploring
regions hitherto unknown.

Of two such attempta especially we have some
detailed accounts. One called the Periplus of Hanno
was a long eoasting voyage along the South-West of
Africa to about the 8th degree of latitude, conducoed

. by the order of the State with a fieet of 60 vessels.

On his return the admiral drew up a report
officially‚ which was ¹consigned to the archives in
the temple of Baal‚ and part of it is still extant in
a Greek translation. We may still perhaps distin·
guish in his narrative the crocodiles of Senegal, the
sweet-scented forests of Cape Verde, the lofty moun-
taius of Sierra hone, and the fantastic forms of the
Gorillas, so called from a faulty reading of a passage
in the Periphas, The second enterprise under Himilco
was directed along the coast of Portugal and Gaul,
and thence across to the Cassiterides or Scilly‘ Isles, at
which Phoenician adventure in olden times had stopped
in its quest for tin, but from which the Cartha-

ginians pushed on to the neighbouring shores of
Oornwall and of Ireland. ⁵
