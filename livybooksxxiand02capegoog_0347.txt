· Ictumulis. The text points to a place near the mouth of
the Ticinus, about the medem Carbonara, which agrees also·
with the situation oi the place of like name referred to 57. 9.
But Pliny, 32. 21, and Strabo, v. 1. 12, speak of the gold mines
οἶ Victumulae' or Ictumuli in the districtos Vercellae, and there
are still traces oi them near Biella to the north oi Vercellae,
while there were none near the mouth of the Ticinus. In
later times the Romans found a prctext ior a war with the
Salassi, >and despoiled them oi the mines in question, and it
is probable that the contractors who sarmed them afterwards

the whole neighbourhood until the colony oi Eporedia was
planted in the contre oi the mining district. O. Ι. L. v. 2, p. 715.

§7- mancipium, the ‘taking by the hand,' was a, symbol

of purchase, and thus the term was used alike ior the right
of ownership (e.g. vitaque mancipio nulli datur), as also for the
slave as the property oi his master.

§8- silicem retinens. The knife of flint was used for
sacrificial purposes till late in the days of the Empire, as we
see from the Acta fratrum Arvalium. It was probably a
custom oi immemorial antiquity, retained irom the ages which
had little use of metals, by a religious conservatism which

fea-red to change its forms, cf. the proverb inter sacrum saxum-
