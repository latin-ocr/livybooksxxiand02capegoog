alone could a point 01 view be found upon the summit, com·
manding an extensive prospect 01 1110 Italian plain, such as
that which Hannibal is said to have had before him, when he
tried to revive the drooping courage 01 1110 soldiers. The spot
in question is not however on the road itself, but on a ridge
which was little likely to have tempted the weary men to need·
less efforts through the snow 101· 1110 sake 01 a fine view. Nor
was 1110 actual prospect 01 importance 101· 1110 general· s appeal.

we must remember that Livy had little knowledge 01 1110 Alps3
that he may easily have given a different colom-ing to the
account of the general’s address which he found in the old
annalists3 and that he was thinking more 01 rhetorical effect
than 01 011101 accuracy· 01 local statements. ο

rugged country which lies between the Drac, 1110 Romanche‚
and the Duranco, and which until lately was almost unex-
plored, and ill described upon the maps. Some hopelessly
conflict with 1110 main data 01 1110 ancient authors, and the
books or pamphlets written in their defence are only monu-
ments 01 misplaced ingenuity and learning. None 01 111000

It should 110 stated in conclusion that the claims 01 1110
Little St Bernard‚ or the Graian Alps, to be the-pass intended
by Polybius were recogmzed by General Melville 1n 1775, whose

view was expanded by M. de Luc in 1818. Messrs Cramer ’

and Wickham in the Dissertation 01 1820 supported the same
theory, and Mt Law in his master-ly work upon the subject
seems to have proved decisivoly that the evidence points to that
conclusion, while Livy’s pass must be the Mont Genevre.
Niebuhr and Mommsen have accepted the authority 01 Poly

bius m favour 011110 Graian Alps.
