Ro U TE OF HANNIBAL. ⁸ 311

seems to point to an entirely different route from that which
has been traced above. After speaking of the civil strife among
· the natives of the Island‚ and then of the supplies furnished to
Hannibal -in return for his decisive succour, he makes him
turn ad laevam in his way towards the Alps. Of the various
explanatione offered of this p‚hrase two only give a likely
meaning. The first assumes that he retraced his steps across
the Isere and down the Rhone‚ and then turned to the left up

the banks of the river Drbme. The other view leaves the bulk
.of the army on the· South of the Iniere, while a detachment only
crosses to decide the civil war, which done, the whole con-
tinues on its march along the Eastern or left bank up to
Grenoble. But the latter version can make little of the words
in Tricastinos flexit which are coupled with ad laevam, for
the Tricastini lay further to the South, and their chief town,
called afterwards 6Αιιριιετα Tricastinorum‚' may be most pro-
bably identified with Aoste on the Drome, though by some
-placed lower down near ‘ St Paul trois chateaux’ upon the
Rhone. The advocates therefore of the march up the Isere,
assume that the words in question have slipped out of their
proper place in a passage which describes the march up the
river towards the Island. Accepting the earlier explanation
> we may follow the track described ‚by Livy along the Dromo up ,
to Aoste‚ and thence to Die, which stands for Dea Vocontiorum,
· a powerful tribe here mentioned by him, whose northern bor·
ders reached up to the Isere and the Drac, while their frontier
on the South-East extended far along the road to Gap and to
Embrun‚.through which country Hannibal may 'have led his
troops, skirting the lands of the Tricorii who were spread to
the North-west. He would thus have reached the Durance,
the Druentia of Livy, and have made his way to Briancm, and
across the Mont Genevre, known to the Romans of -the time of
Oaesar as the Alpes Juliae, though afterwards called Cottiae,
after the native chieftain who did so much to improve the
mountain 'roads about him to win the favour of Augustus.
It would seem to have been the same route, though in a con-
trary direction, which Julius Caesar followed in his march into
Transalpino Gaul, as indicated in the words ‘ab Ocelo, quod
est citerioris provincia, extremum, in fines Vocontiorum ulteri-
oris provinciae dic septimo pervenit ,· inde in Allobroqumfincae.’
B. Ge. 1. 10. 5. It is the same track also in the main by which
Livy v. 34 brings Bellovesus with his Gallio hordes through
the Tricastini, and the Taurini Saltus into the plains of Lom-

bardy where they settled, at the end of the regalp eriod of Rome.

From the. Island to t’he ascent itself‚ the narratives of Livy

and Polybius have no points in common, the local names
furnished by the former being entirely absent in the latter,
while the other conditions of the march are quite distinct.
