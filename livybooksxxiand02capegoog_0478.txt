808 APPENDIX I.

The value 01 this passage turns upon the meaning of ia
aealtm. It might refer solely to the pass 01 Ηο1011108, but as
the writer must have known the traditione of the Gallie hordes
who erossed the Alps, it is more probable that 11018 speeially
referring to the Graian chain, as that over which both Hercules
and Hannibal had passed.

4. Some lines of Varro, the learned writer on antiquities
at the elose of the Republie, are quoted sor us by Servius in
his commentary on Vergil x. 13: quas (Alpes) quinquo viis
Varro dicit transiri posse .· una quoe cuju-‘cta mare per Ligures.-
altera qua Hannibal transiit: tertia qua Pompeius ad His-
paniense bellum prosecute est .· quarta qua Hasdrubal de Gallia
in Italiam venit .- quinta quae quondam a Gracia postona eet,
quoe exinde Alpes Graioe appellantur.

' 5. Sti-abc, who wrote under Tiberius, eites Polybius as men·
tioning four passages across the Alps· τέτταρας ὑπερβάσια

it should be noted that the important words ἢν A. δ. do not

regarded as a commentos Strabo, rather than an extract from
Polybius. Strabo himself shows elsewhere little interest
in the route oi Hannibal, and does not mention it where it
would naturally oecur.

Now it we turn to the third book oi Polybius we shall find
that the whole Journey from Carthago Nova to the Italian plains
is definitely messui-ed. We are told that there were 2600
stadia to the river Iberus, and thence to Emporeion 1600, and
1600 more to the passage 01 the Rhone. From the Rhone to
the beginning of the Alps (πρὸ ς τὴν ἀναβολήν των Ἁλιέων)
there were 1400, while the remainder os the way (λοιπαὶ αὶ τῶν
A. υπερβολαί) was 1200 stadia.

As far as the Pyrenees there is no doubt about the route,
but mueh depende upon the place at which the Rhone was
crossed‚ as that becomes the starting- point for future measure-
ments.

The description of Polybius clearly indicates a passage near
the town of Orange, about the village os Roquemaum, as that
is halfway between the river' s mouth and its iunetion with the
Isere, while it should be aeeording to the historian four days'
march to· either point. The actual distance 01 75 miles to the

latter statements. There is also a long streteh of broad stream
unbroken by any islands to suit with the words κατὰ τὴν
