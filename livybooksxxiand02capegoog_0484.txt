314 . ΔΡΡΕΝΠΙΧ I.

though difleting in details, agree in the main features of the
mun-which they assume to have passed along the Southern
bank of the laete, across the Drac and the Romanche‚ and up
the Val de Gresivaudan, at some point of which the beginning
of the mountain ground is reckoned which extends over the
heights that part the valleys of the Arc and of the Doria.
They agree also in the attempt to reconcile the statements of
both the ancient authors, by correcting them pretty freely where
theytsee the need. In this we may note especially the following
pom s.

1. It is supposed that Polybius mistook the Isere for the
Rhene, though he travelled himself over the ground, and stated

{flaththehatzmy kept near the latter river till they began to climb
e eig .

2. The Auobroqes, who are recorded as the native tribes
with which the invaders came into collision in their way up
to the Alps, are commonly assigned to the North of the Isere,
which was afterwards the insula Allobrogum. 'Ibe theory be·
fore us transfers them without the slightest evidence, to the
southern bank, assuming that they had no definite bordets.
or that the name itself was quite a vague one, loosely used for
Gallio tribes, and possibly still lingering in the Allevard near
st J ean de Maurienne.

3. The march along the Isere inverts the description of
Polybius. In the earlier stages the Carthaginians must have
moved o'ver rugged country ill suited for their horse, and ex-
posed to native ensem, while the easier ground comes higher
up in the Val de Gresivaudan‚ and no definite point can be
agreed on to suit the measurement of distance given.

4. 'l'he passage of the Romanche would have been formid-
able in the face of the Grauis, who are described as repelled only
by the cavalry or by the succour of a friendly chieftain.

5. 'l'he Druentia of Livy must be explained to be the Drac,
which the track in question crossed‚ while it lay far away from
the Durance‚ for which Druentia is the undoubted name in
ancient times, known as it was as the line of communication
across the Alps with Spain.

6. The character of the Mont Cenis itself has been com-
pared minutely with the narrative before us, and with some
forcing of the text it has been shown that the measurements
of time and distance may possibly be verified. We noed not
stay to discuss these attempts. It is not difficult to find some
features of resemblance in almost every pass to the soenes and
incidente described upon the march, and if they were the only

data we might well despair of an definite conclusion. white
rocks can be found also near e road, such as that de la·
