g 4. plus quam modica. Fabius Pictor (ap. Polyb. 111.
8) stated that Hasdrubal returned to Carthago from Spain,
with the design oi making himself despot‚ but being opposed
by the ἀξιόλογοι ἄνδρες, he returned to Spain, disregarding
henceforth the authority of the senate, as did his successor
Hannibal. “ This Polyb. regards as an idle effort of faction to
throw all the odium of the war on the Barcino faction, which
later history reflecting such jealousies of party calls an ἑταιρία

ΡΙοὴοιιι...Ρι-Ηιωρωιι. See the Introduction for a sketch of
the government of Carthago. Livy here, as elsewhere, employs
{ss‘ghffi'nass Roman terms, as if the constitutional usages were

non sane. Fabri.

ἕ 5. hospitiis. Formal contracte of friendly allianee were
often entered into in the old world between persone, families
and tribes, pledges of which were interchanged as ξύμβολα or
tesserae. Documenta are still preserved in the inscriptions in
which engagements of this kind are entered into or formally
renewed‚ as in one where two Spanish clans (yentilitates) of the
same tribe hospitium vetustum antiquom renovaverunt eique
omues alie alium in fidem clientelamque suam suorumque libero-
rum posterorumque recepit. One form lasted on in Greece in the
προξενία which was largely used in commercial and religione
intercourse. Corssen 1. 796 explains hospes as a shortened
form of hosti-pe(t)s = stranger·protectin‘g from root patio =
πόσις. As to the root qhas- from which he derives hostia,
Mommsen, R. 1⁴⁸. 326, regards it as simply: ‘to eat.’ Corssen
says it is to ‘tear' or ‘wound.'

conciliandis. Hasd. according to Diodorus, 25. 17, married
himself the daughter of one of the Sp. chieftains3 principes
may be distinguished from requli as nobles from kings, as
Weissenborn suggests.

56. nihilo tutior. For the form of the phrase Fabri
compares nihilo accuratior v. 37. 1, nihilo quietior, 11. 37. 1,
nihilo facilior, mr. 26. 5.
