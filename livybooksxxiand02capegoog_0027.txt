ΙΝ the earliest times of which history ean take aoss
count we find the traces of an active trade in the
Mediterraneum wat-ers which was mainly in the hands
of the Phoenician merchenlae. The enterprising mee
which peopled the narrow strip of Oanaan hemmed in
between tho mountains and the sea, soon found out
its voeation in the carrying trade of the probini-‚orie
world. Its colonists pushed their way along the
coast of Asia Minor, and through the isles of the
AEgean, planting their faetories on every favoured
spot, and opening up the minora} wealbh or purple
fisheries of the countries on their way; their inter-
change of national products gave the first stimulus to
the enei-gy of many a baekward raee, while their mer-
chant navy probably supplied the wants of the great land
