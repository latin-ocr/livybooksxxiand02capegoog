lently chosen to watch the movements of Hannibal whose easiest
rond to Rome lay through Umbria hythe Via Flaminia, which
had been made a few years before by Ο. Flaminius, Π com·
manications were kept up between the two consuls at Arretium
and Ariminum they might hope to combine the forces when the
route oi the invaders was discovered. Precisely the same ar-
