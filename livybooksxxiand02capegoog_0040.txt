homes and fatherland. Carthage relied upon her
wealth to buy the raw material of her armies. Her
people were too busy at their work of agriculture,
industry‚ or commerce‚ to be spared for the soldier’s
unproductive trade 3 but there was no lack of markets
in ruder and less civilized countries where men might
b'e had for money's worth. Their recruiting officere
went far afield, and the motley host thus gathered to
their banners must have presented a strange spectacle
indeed, as Heeren pictures to our fancy. “Hordes of
half-naked Gauls were ranged next to companies of
white-clothed Iberians‚ and savage Liguriam next to
the far-travelled Nasamones and Lotophagi 3 Cartha·
ginians and Liby-phoenicians formed the oentre, the
former of whom were a sort of separate corps, dignified
by the title of the sacred legion 3 while innumerable
troops of Numidian horsemen, taken from all the
tribes of the desert, swarmed around upon unsaddled
horses, and formed the wings 3 the van was composed
of Balearic slingers, and a line of colossal elephante,
with their Ethiopian guideS, formed as it were a chain .
of moving fortresses before the whole army.”
Multitudinous gatherings like these took time to
raise, still more to hold well in hand and turn to good
account 3 pestilence often hovered in their train, and
they were commonly soon shattered by the onset of
steady infantry like that of Rome. There was yet
another danger in their use, which was now to be

brought home to them in an appalling shape.
