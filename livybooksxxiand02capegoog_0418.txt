latum cum Groecis esset, Liv- vm. 28. 7. But to mark the dis·
tinctive character oi this prov-oyem in this and other cases the
official was always spoken of not as maqistratus but pro παρίε-
trata, and 101· a long time a vote oi the people as well as a
resolution of the senate was needed. It was at first resorted to
only in the case of imperium milities, or the highest command
away from Rome, and never to the imp. domi, in which a
praefectus iuri dicundo or an interrex ste pped into the place 01
an absent or deceased official. It was, however, sparingly
adop ted· ιιι case of lower offices at Rome. With the institution
of provincia the prorogation became a regular procedure, and a
proconsul οι· pr ωεστ· was appointed for each, but towards the
end 01 the Repu ulio an interval of at least 5 years was r uired
between the office of consul and proconsul, proetor an pro·
proetor.

Ρ, 99, 5 2. portum ·1“. Hiibner remarks that Strabo calls
Τ. ἀλίμενος ιιι. 4. 7, and that it is still one of the worst reads
on the Spanish coast, though Eratosthenes spoke oi a ναύσταθ·
μου there. Yet 8 years late'r Ο. Claudius Nero sailed direct
from Puteoli to Tan-acc, xm 17. 2, though the troops more
commonly disembarked at Emporia and marched to Τ. until
the fall 01 Carthago Nova changed the centre oi operations.

5 4. nec ullo viso, for et nullo, as the negative belongs not
to the main sentence, but to the secondary clause. 'l'bis con·
fusion is of frequent occurrence in Livy, cf. vn. 9. 1, quum...

maditus, i.e. to the governor oi the gan-ison. They were

and the supposed fidelity oi the guard, ιιι. 98.

5 5. liberum. Τ110 contracted form oi this gen. plur. is
very usual in Livy as in duum and socium.

56. 9. Τ110 object oi Abelux was not merely that the‘ gain
might be as great as possible’ taking emolumentum as the
subi ect, but that 110 might ‘himself profit his new allies.’
