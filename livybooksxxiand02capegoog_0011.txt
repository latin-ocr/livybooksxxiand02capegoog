PREFAOE

ο THE text of Livy which is here adopted is a

reprint of Madvig's, whose Emendationes Livianoe
discuss most of the important variatione from the
common text. To that work therefore reference

. is made when Madvig’s authority or arguments

are mentioned in the notes.

In matters of Latinity the commentary of
Fabri, as enlarged by Heerwagen, has been found
most useful, especially the illustrations drawn
from Latin authors, „Weissenborn's notes for
German schools are quoted only (as W) when
they contain information which is not to be
found in earlier commentatore.

In questions of etymology most stress is laid

- upon the views of Oorssen in his Ausspracha ⁹
ι Vocalismus, w. Betonuny der Lateinischen Spraohe„
