202 NOYES. XXI. c. xxxvr. ’ᾖ 1- 6.

ut πετο.. 'I'his would be absurdlyexaggerated if it referred
to the ordinary state oi the pass. 11 however we understand
it as caused by a recent landslip or avalanche, it would be
consistent with experience. There is one spot especially on
the Little St Bernard exposed to such easualties, and to this
the description os Polybius well applies. He speaks however
os the road being carried away, σχεδὸν ἐπὶ τ ’ ἡμιστάδια, but
Livy· mistaking this, or the language of tffli‘r common au-
thonty, converte it into a precipice of a 1000 feet in depth (if
we accept, that is, Valla's almost certain corrections oi the
meaningless readings of the MSS.). ‘This‚’ says Niebuhr, ‘is
nonsense, as all must see.'

expeditus. Cf. vn. 34. 3, collem aditu arduum impedito
cymini, expeditis haud difficilem. So expediti equites ‘ light
troops) Expedita elassis, cymen, venatores, διο. in Livy.

P, 39, 5 2. admodum = maxime, sere, μάλιστα..

5 3. miranti = cum admiratione quoerenti by pregnant use.
cf„ 1. 41. 1, mirantium quid rei esset, 111. 35. 5. Niigelsbach,
p. 279, illustratos this by such cases as dodrantem complere-.-
complementi causa adiicere, triarii postremos claudebant ior
claudentes postremi ibant.

5 4. circa. On use of the adverb cf. note ou 7. 5.

circumduceret=must take round. On this use of the subi.
for circumducere deberet, v. Madvig, De Finibus 11. 35, who
quotes various passages from Cicero and Livy, ιι.. 37. 3, non
triumphum impedire debuit...sed postero die...nomen defervet.
Of. also Verg. AEn. 11. 643, at tu dictis Albane maneres. Ovid,
Tristia 1v. 3. 34, Tristis es.- indiynor, quod sim tibi causa
doloris ,⁰ non es ,- at amisso conjuye diqna fores.

ξ 5. super veterem... ‘ Over the snow of the last season,
which had not melted.’ A mass oi snow often falls into a
ravine or valley, where it is sheltered from the sun’s heat, and
remains through a whole summer, forming sometimes a great
natural bridge, through which a river tunnels for itseli a
channel. Probably the early historiens referred to some such
mass which blocked up the spot where H. tried to force a
passage. Livy's account would be more natural in the case of
a glacier, which was not likely to be met with in their way.

moad. nuenton... ⁶ The liquid mud formed by the melting

tabem is the correction of Gronovius for the labem of‘the
MSS. lt is especially used of any melting substance.
