have offered. The earlier writer Caelius Antipater, whose work
on the Punio ware was largely used by Livy, brought the in·

other authore, but which may remind ue in ite eound of the

was oooupied by the Salassi, while the Gallio Libui held the
lower country. Tradition eommonly, says Livy, knows nothing
oi these names in thia connection, but makes Hannibal issue
{rom the mountains through the tribe of the Taurini, with
whom he first oame into hostile oontaet. The Roman historiari
admits that there was no sure evidenoe before him, and that he
relies mainly on tradition3 the aooount oi Polybius he did not
notice. But tradition in this matter was a guide of little
value. From the time when Scipio found himself too late
upon the Bhone, till he iaoed his enemy on the Ticinus, the
Roman government had entirely lost eight of the Carthaginien
leader. The country through whioh he passed was quite un·
known to them, and no truetworthy iniomation oould be for-
warded to Rome, or lodged in the offioial arohives. The Gallie
mountaineers remained long unsubdued, and the eventful
tramp oi many a later army effaoed from their minda the
memory oi the march os Hannibal. 'l'he popular legend of
two oenturiee later was hardly likely to be aoourate in euoh
details. It was known indeed that the Taurini were attaoked
