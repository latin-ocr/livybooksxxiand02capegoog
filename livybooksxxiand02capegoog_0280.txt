170 NOTES. XXI. c. 111. §4-0. xm. 53.

gical blunder, by which the tentare from teum, tendere was
assimilated to the templus irom temnere, in which the p was
inserted ior euphony between m and n.

Hispanum. Either generally, or in distinction to the
Saguntinos who were said to be of foreign race.

movebant. Fabri remarks on the frequent use oi the
imperf. with’ postquam, in cases where the action is supposed
still to continue. Cf. 111. 60. 8, postquam jam multa dies erat,

neque movebatur quicquam.

condiciones. ⁴ Harsh conditione were named as might be
expected irom an implacable enemy! This spelling of con·
dicio is almost invariably found in the best MSS. and inscrip-
tions; the derivation from condere must therefore be given up
in favour of that which connects it with dicio, judicare, δίκη,
and the root dile. On the use of ut, ei. 7. 7.

transfuga ex or. ‘Turned deserter instead of advocate?

sub condic. The sub is very rarely used in this connexion,
as condicio is used absolutely in the abl. Heerwagen thinks
that it emphasizes the dependent condition of the Sagun·

tines.

P. 14, 5 6. interpretem. For the use of the word cf. 11.
33. 14, huic interpreti arbitroque concordioe civium. Curtius

connects interpres with S. prat, and φραδ, φράσσω.
- publice S. ‘Recognized by the State oi Saguntum as,’ stc. ·

§3- senatus datus. ‘Audience was given in the senate

phrase is used in Livy, but in some it can only refer to a
special meeting convened ior the purpose, as in xxvx. 21. 1,
where the praetor calls the senate together to discuss the
claime oi an applicant ior a triumph. So too of the corres-
ponding expressions, xxm. 7. 11, senatum extemplo postulat,
where the demand is for a special meeting.

c. 1111. 51. veni. The subi. venissem of the Mes. here ”

seems out oi place in reference to the definite hoc iter, and
Madvig reads veni. sed, thinking that this was written veni
set, then changed to venisset, and afterwards as a mistake in
the person to venissem.

5 2. pro. ‘In the name of‚' ‘ out of regard for)

g 3. loqui, quae loquor. A sort of repetition constantly
occurring in Latin writers. Fabri compares Quintil. 11. 3. 80,
accedit et ex illa fiyura qratia, qua nomina dixi mutatis casibus
repeti ‘ non minus cederet quam cessit?

vel ea fides sit. ‘ Evidence may be found =in the fact that)
