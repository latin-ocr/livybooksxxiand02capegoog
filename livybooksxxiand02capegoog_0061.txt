pride. The classical historiam of later date, we
know, followed the same course, and still more cer-0
tainly, the chroniclers of the middle ages. For the
most part it would seem that they were quite content
in each part of their work with following one au·
thority alone, and that they transcribed freely from
it for a time, with little effert ιο balance or correct
from other sources, till at length another was taken
in its place, ιο be used for a while with equal free-
dom. But in the third decade of Livy the elementa

of the mosaic are much smaller than in the fourth ·

or fifth 3 the passages are shorter where the agreement
with Polybius is most marked, and yet in them the

variatione are often too minute and numerous to be
consistent with such a method of procedure as that
whichhasbeen stated. IfLivyhadhadthepages
of Polybius before him, he would probably have fol-
lowed him more closely, as the differences are often

not improvements.
5. The reasons given, as weU as others which

arise from a detailed compat-ison between the two,
point to a common use of the same sources, rather
than ιο a direct borrowing of the one historian from
the other. But they must have dealt with these iu
different fashion, Livy keeping close ιο the early
narrative in its fuller form, while the edition which
Polybius gives is a summai-y and corrected one. It
rema-ins then ιο ascertain, if possible, the nature of
these common sources.
