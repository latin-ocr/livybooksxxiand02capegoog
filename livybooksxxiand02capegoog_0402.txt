§8- ubertim. 'l'he slaves of a Roman, when freed, were
called his liberti, and passed into the class of libertini. These
were by Q. Fabius in 303 n-o. 'all enrolled in the 4 urbana tribus,
where their votes oounted for little, but in later days repeated
efforts were made by the popular leaders to spread them over
the νικήσω tribus where they might own land. 'l'hey eould
not serve regularly in the legions, for military service was
regarded at Rome as the privilege and duty of the free land-
owners, and it was not until the time oi Marius that this senti-

ment disappeared.

the privilege allowed to Latini to migrate to Rome and become

says it was so named quia montibus proestat, and in {aet it

mersis lim. ‘eroes-reads? as in 11. 89 transversis tra-
mitibus and v. 16. -4 obliquis tramitibus in the same sense. It
would seem as ii trames (tram. meare) were nearly the same
as transversus, while limes (for lic-mes, connected with limus,
λέχριος, limen, a eroes-boam for lintel) eomes from the same
