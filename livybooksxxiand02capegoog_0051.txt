INTRODUOTION. II. xxxiii

that of Livy.

Upon careful scrutiny it may be seen that in
many passages of the two writers there is very close
resemblance in the language used, more especially in
dealing with the first part of the war. The me-

ledging his debts, or even mentioning him by name
until the end (xxx. 45. 4). We can lay little stress
indeed upon this silence, for ancient writers had no
scruples in using the materiale which they found
ready to their hands3 they horrowed often largely
from each other, and had no delicacy of feeling
about such debts of honour. But there is good
