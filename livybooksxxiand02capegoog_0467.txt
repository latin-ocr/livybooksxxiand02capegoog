APPENDIX 1. ’
ON THE ROUTE 01⁴* HANNIBAL

'rna passage of Hannibal across the Alps was even in Livy’s
days a controverted question, as we may gather from his
words (ιιι. 38. 6) ‘ambiyi quanam Alpes transierit! It is still
matter of disputo, and endless varieties of route have been
proposed, most of which however are hopelessly at variance
with the language of the ancient writers, or with the nature of
the ground, as since explored. More οι· less definite state-
ments on the subject are found in the following authorities,

1. Polybius was ,born during the war, and after some time
spent in public life in Greece‚ was taken as one of the Achaean
hostages to Rome. He lived there in the society of distin-
guished men, whose fathers might have taken part in the
great struggle: he sought, as he tells us, information from
contemporary witnesses, and travelled himself among the Alps
to gather further knowledge in the scenes of the events. He
was eminently accurate and truthful as a writer, and his

ggthggity is undoubtedly first-rate. His account is found 111.

2. We have the narrative of Livy (ΧΠ. 23-38), who wrote
two centuries after the second Punic war began. His work
was on too large a scale to admit of very special studies for the
period before us; he makes n'o claim to personal knowledge of
the localities in question3 his descriptions of 'topography are
often vague and indistinct ; and on all grounds his evidence
on these points must rank far lower than that of the Greek.
writer. ’

3. There is a passage bearing on this subject in the life of
Hannibal by Cornelius Nepos, the contemporary and friend of
Cicero· Ad eas (Alpes) posteaquam venit quoe, Italiam ab
Gallia sejunyunm quas nemo unquam cum exercitu ante eum
praeter Herculem Graium transierit, quo sacto is hodie saltus
