called, oonsisting entirely of citizens, and planted espeoially
upon the ooast, or on the great reads, to bar the way of an
invader; and the Latin, in whioh the peoples of Latium, and
of other allied raoes, were invited to take part, whioh were
settled on ground lately won‚ and served as garrisons on a
disputed frontier. These were therefore doubly useiul, as
holding in eheok danger-ons enemies, and as pledges for the
tfiilielitgvlsof oldhallies, who could look only to Rome ior help in
eir ’ tant omes.

ς 3. triumviri. Commissioners were commonly appointed
to direct the work of the ayrimemores, whioh was carried out
with serupulous nioety on traditional principles, and to assign
the allotments, the sizo of whioh was determined by the
senate or eommons. Polyb. m. 40 says that there were 6000
oolonists in each, and that they were directed to be on the
spot within 30 days. Note the anomaly of the form triumviri,
duumviri, whioh grew probably« out of the use of the singular
tm'umvir, as one of a board of three.

Eutina was itself a Roman oolony, Polyb. 111. 40, though
Livy states that it was oolonized with Parma in 184 B. ο.
(L. xmx. 55). That the Romans ohose well the sites of their
oolonies is illustrated by the· importanee os the towns os
Modena, Piaeenza and Cremona.

ς 5. Id quoque dubium. As the walls were already bunt,
there seems reason to doubt whether the commission was not
sent for some other purpose than to assign the allotments.

ι. 9. 6, ad muliebre inqenium efficaces preces, Oio. Fam. 10. 17. 2,

omitted. Of. Nagelsbaoh, p. 339.

as formidable in the first onset, but as incapable of sustained
effort. Of„ x. 27. 3, G'. primo impetu feroces esse.. Gallo-
rum corpora intolerantissima laboris atque oesttoe fluere.

ἕ 7. obsides. These hostages had been given at the olose
of the late war with the Gauls.

subject Mutina proesidiumque„ ,
