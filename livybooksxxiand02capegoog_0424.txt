proclmmdm A contemptuous term instead oi orando.

proclamatorem aut rabulam hoc ser-mone nostro conquirimus.

¹¹2² notitiam...houores. ‘ Attained to notoriety, and then to
public office.’ These honours were the lower offices afterwards

included in the comprehensive term υἰρῑηείυἰναιιιε, eompnsmg
several boards‚ the lowest rank in a political career.

5 8. duabus ndu. Only three cases are known of men
who held both aedileships, but one or other was a necessary
step in an official career, and was heavily weighted with the
expenses oi the publio shows.

ἕ 4. dictatoria invidia. For this use of an adjective,
to express the object of the substantive, ci. Cic. cluent. 28. 77,
ex invidia senatoria crescere, Liv. m. 42. 6, posito decemvirali
odio, 1111. 18. 10, divino humanoque scelere liberari.

sciti plebis. Commonly in the order plebei-scitum. Cf.
Festus, p. 293, scita plebei appellantur ea quoe plebs me affra·

. there was no constitutional impossib⁸ 'ty in this is shown by

the appointment oi M. J unia Pera and M. Fabius Puteo at the
same time, and though the latter is made to say neque duos
dictatores tempore uno, quod nunquam antea sactum esset, pro·
bare se, Liv. xxm. 23. 2, yet he accepted office notwithstanding.
'l'he fasti do not recognize Minucius as dictator, but an in·

that ege <squamae imperio is quite unknown to constitutiones
proc ure.

c. mn. g 3. ωσι-θαι minori. In technical language the
maqistratus maiores were those who had the imperium, together
with the censors‚ while all the rest were minore-93 but the

potestas as compared with all other officere, and the consul re-
latively to the praetor.

case oi Q, Fabius, who as παρίκει· equinam disobeyed the
instructions oi the dictator Papirius Cursor, and though he
gained a victory, nearly suffered for his want oi discipline,
no· 822. cf. Livy vm. 32. 6, tunc Papirius redimam-ata ira
spoliari magistrum equitum ac viv-yae et secum expediri inanit.
