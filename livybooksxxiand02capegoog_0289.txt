NOTES. . XXI. ο. xm. §4-0, nv. 53. 1⁷1

Ο
5 4. Postque-mmm ‘Now that there is? A rare se·
quence of tense, as the est is not the historical present. It
should be postquam eo ventum est ut. Heerwagen compares 80.
5, postquam multo majorem partem itineris emensam cernant.

§5- cuius ita. ‘ Some slight hope of which is left pro·
vided that you accept its terms as con uered men, seeing that
H. dictates them as a conqueror, and ο not think of what you
forfeit as a loss, but of what you are allowed to keep as afree
gift, seeing that all you have is at your conqueror's mercy.’
The change of mood from the audiatis of the MSS. which
most editors retain, to habituri estis, can hardly be explained
on any principle, so Madvig reads audietis after Gronovius.

P. 15, ἓ 6. captam habet. A strong form of the perfect
for a completed act, assensum militem habebat, 11. 3.

ἕ 7. binis. Why this instead of sinyulis, 12. 5, we do not
131onae ἀἓὲΙὲιιῗεὲιιε therefore suggested privis as privis tunicis

ς 8. Equidem. The e seems to be an intensifying particle
as in edepol (e. dem. Pollux), equirius, ecastor, adius Fidius,
another form of medius Fidius. Corssen‚ 11. 857.

ς 9. patienda...sinat1s. Note the change of construction,
patiamini being understood in patienda.

trucidari. Derived by Gorssen from truncum coedere, as if

sho5rtgzelned from truci-cidare like stipendium for otipiapendium,
11. .

c. nv. ἓ 1. paulatim. Like raptim, confestim, this adverb
seems to be an accusative form of an abstract substantive
otherwise lost. Corssen 11. 532 explains paulus, or paullus the
older form, as a diminutive paurulus from a root pam-o, pre-
served in παῦρος, like misellus, tenellus, διο. for miser-ulus,
tener-ulus. So the name Paulus means ‘the little man' as
Crassus ‘the fat man.’

argentum aurumque omne. Livy seems in this chapter to
combine two accounts of the event, one of which emphasized
the tragic despair of the S„ while another reported inqem
proeda and captivi. Polybius 111. 17 after a very short ac-
count of the siege dwells on the booty gained. Like stories
of the self-destruction of the inhabitants were told in the case
of other Spanish towns in later times. Cf. xxvm. 23, J uv. xv.
93. Compare also tho sieges of Numantia and Zaragoza.

ς 3. memento. More frequently with temporis, or horoe,
not absolutely, as here and in 111. 63. 1, ΗΠ. 22. 9.
