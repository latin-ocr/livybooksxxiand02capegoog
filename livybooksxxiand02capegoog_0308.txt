5 8. libyphoenices. The Phoenician settlers who had
many centuries before settled in the interior of Africa, were
supposed to have come through Sidon, and to be agricultural
tribes dispossessed perhaps by J oshua from Palestine. As such
they betook themselves not to trade but husbandry in their new
homes, and by their mixture with the natives gave rise to a
new race, whose name implies this fusion, like the Celtiberi,
or the mixed race in the South of Spain, where the Carthagi-

larger contingent, and that there is no such addition as ex
Hispania in the corresponding passage of Polyb„ where the
MSS, have Λεργετῶν. He believed therefore that in both
texts the name oi some unknown African tribe must have been
changed by mistake for that of a known Spanish one.
