’ξ 8. Ausetanos. The description, prope Hiberam, is pro-
bably a mistake of Livy, as the geographer-s put them near
Vich and Gerena, cf. 23. 2. Scipio most likely attached the
Ausetani first, and then the Laeetani, who lay along the coast
as far as Baroelona‚ and finally the poweriul Ilergetes, whom

here, and in the next book oi Livy, are doubtless extracted
directly, or through the Annalists from the records oi the
colleyium pontificum. They may seem ludicrous to a modern
reader, but it would be rash to assume, as has been lately
suggested, that they were intended by Livy to stir any feeling
oi ridicule or disbeliei. It was enough for his purpose to
