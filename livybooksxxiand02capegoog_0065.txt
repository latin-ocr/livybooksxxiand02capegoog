literary treatment, for which the first chroniclers
cared little, but which seemed of pmmount impor-
tance as the teste for rhetoric inm-cased. Thus
Cicero speaks contemptuously of the meugre md
graceless annale, rough hewn, us he implies, by pren·
tice hands which had as yet no experience or skill
of litei-ary craft (De Orat. 11. 12).

and L. Calpurnius Piso took a high rank in the
world of politica, but are included in Cicero's sweeping
censure as historiens without s style. The first who
aimed at dignity of language was Caelius Antipater,
who lived in the period of the Gracchi, a century later
than the first chroniclers just mentioned. There was
