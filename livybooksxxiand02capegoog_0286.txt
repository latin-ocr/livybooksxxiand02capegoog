168 NOTES. XXI. c. 11. ἐξ 1—7.

more often in putting nomen after cognomen as Crassus
Licinius, Antias Valeriae.

g 2. ortum ab 8. Polyb. m. 15 refers to a despatch from
Η. to Carthago complaining of aggressione of the Saguntines
on the Carthaginien subjecte. Saguntinos short for Sagunti·
norum societatem. Cf. 11. 10. 1, Postumium...devotiom P.
Decii...oequabant, and many like examples in Livy.

P. 12. vetustissima. The earliest treaty of Β. with Ο.
dated trom 508 Β. c.

g 3. fessum habebat. 'I'he verb habere, besides its auxi-
liary use, implies the continuance oi the result. cf. Cic. Rep.
111. 14. 24, quum quaereretar cx eo quo scelere impulsus marc
haberet infestum uno myoparone. Fam. 14. 7. 1, sollicitudines
quibus te miserrimam habui. So Lucr. 1. 1068 amplexi quod
habent perverse prima viai.

ira...=nmu1mdo. The abl. accompanied by the gerund is
awkward. The MSS. do not vary, though Gronovius reads

stimulanda, but Fabri observes that Livy does not use stima-

lare iram, but st. aliquem or animum, in other places. Usener ·

supposes promittme to have-slipped out of the second half of

times is described by Vegetius, 1v. 17, as 30 to 50 feet square,
and so high as to overtop, not the walls only, but the towers of
the besieged city. It was covered with raw hides to be
screened from fire, and was moved along on rollers to the
point of attack. In the lowest story was contained a battering
ram, in the middle was a drawbridge, which might suddenly
be lowered and secured with grappling irons to the walls ior a
boarding party, while the higher stories were filled with men
who pom-ed a shower oi missiles of every kind upon the
enemy.

catapultis. Latinized form of κατατέλτης from ἰι-ἄλλω.
With it we may possibly connect pilum. Corssen, 11. 157.

ballistis. See the description in Vegetius 1v. 22, Ballista
funibus ner-vinis tenditur, quoe quanto prolixiora brachiola
κξῖἔῗηε, hoc est, quanto major suerit, tanto spicula lonyim
