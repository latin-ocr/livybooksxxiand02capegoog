patricians. These concilia plebis could only be convened by
a tribune, or mdiIe, and the auspices were not taken before
they met, as in the case oi the comitia. 'l'he resolutione passed
in them, called plebiscita, were long regarded as informal de·
clarations of the will of a single order oi the state, and as
such were never sanctioned by the patrum auctoritas, though
the Hortensian law oi n. c. 288 gave them binding some, and
thus raised them to the level of the leues passed in the comitia.

bias given to the Roman mind in early days, (ci. the charge
against the government oi the Tarquins :sices ac lapicidas
pro bellatoribus factos, Liv. 1. 59. 11‚) whic threw the handi-
crafts and retail trades into the hands oi aliens, and the slave-
