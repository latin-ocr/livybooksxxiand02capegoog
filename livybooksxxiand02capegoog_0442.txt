side oi the river as the greater Roman camp, and opposite to
it, bnt further to the leitgr was the smaller, v. 44. 3. Polybius

5 ’7. pedites, i. 6. sociorum. Poly b., who agrees closely
with Livy, adds here a detail oi importmoe, that the infantry
was drawn np in much greater depth oi ranks than usual.
Both writers state that the Roman line faced southwards, cf.
46. 8, and impl that tho Roman army was drawn up before
the O’arthagimans crossed‚ but neither says definitely whether
the battle was on tho right or left bank. But it would have
been absurd ior the Romans to make their line oi battle iace
to the south, with their right resting on the river, 11 the enemy
was still on the opposite bank, or behind them, as he would
have been, assuming that he was encamped on the leit bank.
Tho battle no doubt took place on the left bank, and the
Roman lines were probably drawn across the ohord oi the aro
formed by the river opposite Gannae. This agrees also with

what 16 implied as to the position oi the Oarthaginian camp,
