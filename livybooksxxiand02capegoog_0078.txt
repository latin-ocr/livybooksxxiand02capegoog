lii INTRODUOQ'ION. I V.

'miique amu-eque paem's exercituum hibmie videm-m,
verterant retro Hannibalem odia. So faulty a MS.
can be little trusted in nice questions of orfflogmphy,
and Madvig accordingly has not attempted to re-
produce the forms of Livy's age, or to g1ve us the
spelling of the historiari himself, but has fallen back
upon the orthography of Quintilian's age, which was
fixed by the authority of critice and grammarian&
and which is known to have differed in material
points from that of Livy’s time, when it was still
shifting and unsettled. ’ It may be convenient how-
ever to formulate some of the chief points of dif-
ference between the spelling most in vogue at the
end of the Republic, and that of a century later,
though with the cantion that we cannot tell exactly
when the change in each case took place, or ‘how far
personal taste may have modified the general fashion.

0.v. vo was atfirst usual, asin moe,vobmw.
The change to vu took a century to effect, from
Augustus to Vespasiam cf. Quintilian 1. 7. 5 26.

Ο. Ε. The change from vortex to verta began
with Scipio Africanus, but some forms advorsus, con·
novor-eia, venter lasted till the Empire, when there
&was doubt between foenoaeie, finum-is, co. ⁸

V. E. We have the later form of the gerundive
of the third and fourth conj. as early as Rc, 185, but
the older form, as facizmdm, appears much later,
especially in archaic formula-ica.

V. Ι. Maxumus, optumus were common before
