P, 62, ς 3. Placentiam· recto it. Livy and Polyb. both
mention the retreat of this body to P. without adding that
they cmssed over a bridge. If we hold to the view that the
battle was fought on the west of the Trebia, we must assume
that they crossed by a permanent bridge held by the garrison
of P.‚ or in boats which they may have found,- as in ἓ 8.

ς 5. audactam ingr. Perhaps to balance the cunctatio
inyredie‘ndi just above. In itself it is an unusual expression,
audacia being commonly used by itself.

fi 8. sauctorum is added to make sense os the passage
which is very harsh without some such epithet, even if mam
ex parte be taken, as Fabri suggesta, with trajicerent. Beside
m. ex parte Livy uses mxima parte, maqna parte, and partem
maynam much in the same sense oi ‘ mainly!

ratibus Τ. This seems decisivo as to Livy’s view that the
battle was fought on the Eastern bank, while the camp was
on the W. ot the Trebia, improbable as it is on all aeoounts.

Polyb. has no corresponding passage, and Iaivy's authority in
matters of geography is very slight.

e. 11v11. ς 1. ,urbem Romanam. Heerwagen notes that
L. uses this ezpression at times with a certain rhetorical
emphasiS, cf. 111. 7. 1.

g 2. altem. This is a correction of Madvig for the
altere...revocato of the MSS„ which mars the antithesis, and
involves an awkward series os phrases,

quas alias leg. There were many legions yet to be called
out„ as subsequent events proved. Polyb. instead of such ex-
aggerations speaks 01 the reinforcements sent to Sicily and
. elsewhere, and remarks that the Romans were most formidable
in times of crisis, 111. 75.

, 5 3. ingenti periculo. A very unneeess expostus, as a
dictator or interrex might have conducte the electione.
Polyb. says that Sempr. concealed his losses in the despatches
to Rome, and does not mention the Journey. As he passed
through Rome on his way to Trebia (Polyb. 111. 68) he might
easily have held the electione there.

P. 63, tenendi. ‘of escaping noticess‘cs. sor this absolute
use 48. 5. xxn. 33. 1. ⁵
