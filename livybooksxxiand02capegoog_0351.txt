stood between the two armies.

(3) The Trebia was between H. and Scipio, and the
attempt made to gain possession of Clastidium which lay on

the West naturally though not necessarily points to Η. being

It would seem therefore on the whole most probable that
Scipio's camp was at first to the West oi the Trebia, and that
he crossed at last to get nearer his base and put the river
between himself and H.- It is doubtful however whether Livy
intended this, and had he been careful of geography he might
have expressed himself more clearly.

κεντίαν, but may point to the conclusion adopted, which is
opposed however to the view ol Niebuhr, Arnold, Liddell and
Weissenborn, but has been adopted by Mommsen.
