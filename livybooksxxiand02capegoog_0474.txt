though diffating-in details, agree in thex main features of the
mtewbich they assume to have passed along the Seuthem
bank of the Isere, across the Drac and the Romanche‚ and up
the Val de Gresivaudan‚ at some point of which the beginning
of the mountain ground is reckoned which extends over the
heights that part the valleys of the Arc and of the Doria-
They agree also in the attempt to reconcile the statements of
both the ancient authore, by correcting them pretty freely where
they see the need. In this we may note especially the following
points.

1. It is supposed that Polybius mistook the Isere for the
Rhone, though he travelled himself over the ground, and stated
ffiathfflehmy kept near the latter river till they began to ch'mb

e eig ts.

2. The Allobroyoe, who are recorded as the native tribes
with which the invaders came into collision in their way up
to the Alps, are commonly assigned to the North of the Isere,
which was afterwards the imula Allobrogum. The theory be·
fore us transfers them without the slightest evidence, to the
southern bank, assuming that they had no definite bordei-s,
or that the name itself was quite a vague one, loosely used fot
Gallio tribes, and possibly still lingering in the Allevard neat
St J ean de Maurienna.

3. The march along the Isere inverts the description of
Polybius. In the earlier stages the Carthaginians must have
moved o'ver rugged country ill suited for their horse, and ex-
posed to native onesta, while the easier ground comes higher
up in the Val de Gresivaudan, and no definite point can be
agreed on to suit the measurement of distance given.

4. The passage of the Romanche would have been formid-
able in the face of the Gauls, who are described as repelled only
by the cavalry or by the succour of a friendly chieftain.

5. The Druentia of Livy must be explained to be the Drac,
which the track in question crossed‚ while it lay far away from
the Durance, for which Druentia is the undoubted name in
ancient times, known as it was as the line of communication
across the Alps with Spain.

6. The character of the Mont Cenis itself has been com-
pared minutely with the narrative before us, and with some
forcing of the text it has been shown that the measurements
of time and distance may possibly be verified. We need not
stay to discuss these attempta. It is not difficult to find some
features of resemblance in almost every pass to the scenes and
incidents described upon the march, and if they were the only
data we might well despair of an definite conclusion. white
rocks can be found also near e read, such as that de la
