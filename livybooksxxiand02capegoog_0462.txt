Patres conscripti. '.I'he writers generally thought that this
phrase denoted the original senators 01 patrician origin, and
the later enrolled of plebeian rank, thus Livy 11. 1. 7,

[Brutus] patrum numerum primoribus equestris aradus electis
ad trecentorum summm explevit.- traditumque inde fertur,

ut in senatum vocarentur qui patres quiq tque conscripti essent.
Servius ad AEn. 1. 426 ascribes them to an earlier change,
conscriptos qui post a Servio Tullio e plebe electi mut. But
it is unlikely that the plebs was admitted in such early times
to the ruling council‚ and conscribere is simply to enrol, as in
the expressions conscribere exercitum, tribum, colleqia. It
is probable that patres conscripti meant only‘ T'hose put upon
the roll of the Senate,’ and so ‘Members oi the senate? Cf.

the refuqerunt of the MSS. which had been long noticed as
suspicions in connection with in acie. Perizonius suggested
ex acie. W. objects to fuerunt that Polybius represents all
the prisoners as the gar-rison leit in the camp, 'but this does

not seem very forcible.

510. extulisse. '.rhe use of the infin. perfect with velle
is oi frequent occurrence, when the result rather than the
progress of the action is to be expressed. The old laws com·
monly have it in prohibitione, as Ne Baccanal habuisse velit,
so Horace, Sat. 11. 3. 187, ne quis humasse velit Aiacem Atride
vetas cur. Os. 1. 2. 28, sunt qui nolint tetigisse. Zumpt, 590.

like extulisse expresses the action in a livelier form as a com-
pleted result. (31. xxx.- 14. 5, nulla.. ,viv-tutum.. ,est qua eqo
