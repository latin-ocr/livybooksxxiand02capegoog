ROUTE ΟΕ HANNIBAL. 309

&xiv ῥύσιν. It is moreover above the iunction with the
Duranoe, to cross over which would have been a needless
,labour ior the army.

The other place suggested near Beaucaire and Tarascon is
quite inconsistent with these data. In Livy there are no
definite statements on the subject to point to any special
place. After the passage 01 the Rhene however he say s that
Hannibal pushed on inland to avoid all contact with the Roman
army ,but phis route was probabl decided on besorehand, and
he was guided by the Gauls, w 0 had invited him to Italy,
and whog would naturally lead him through the passos which
would bring him with most ease into their cantens. ·

Onwardg to the Isere his route is certain, after that 811 18
matter 01 debate.

Our two authorities give alike account 01 the island enclosed
between the Rhene and the 18010- the imula Allobroyum of
later day s-—and 01 the contests between the native powers, in
which Hannibal took p.art In Polybius we find besides the
following data· (1 ‘Hannibal having in ten days marched
800 stadia along t e river, began the ascent of the Alps? (2)
We hear that the chieftain with whom he sided in the quarrel

'I'he words along the river, ’παρὰ τον ποταμόν, 810 not in
themselves definite. They have been taken to refer to the
Isere which was spoken of not long before, and most critics
-accordingly trace the route of Hannibal along one or other 01
its banks. But there can be little doubt that the‘ river' 01
the whole narrative is the Rhone, and 111 chapter 39 Polybius
expressly says that they kept 11081· it to the entrance 01 the
mountain pass. 01 course it is not to be supposed that it was
tracked in all its windings, in the great bend 101· example
which it makes at Ly ons, but only that the general movement
was in the direction 01 its stream. 'I'he country through which
the march would lie was such that the cavalry could be used
to good effect, while the left bank 01 the Isere would not at all
meet this condition, and the right 0110 would only partially
fulfil it. In both cases the mountain country comes 111 sight
too soon, and the ascent (ἀναβολή) must have begun long be-

days’ leisurely advance, in constant 1081· 01 811 attack.

Both these conditione are com plied with by the route, which
following the Rhone up to Vienne, leaves it 101· a while ιιι its
great bend, and meets it once more at St Genix, and thence to
the pass 01 Mont du Chat where the ascent may be taken to
begin. 'l'hat point once reached the way would naturally lead
along the upper course 01 the 18010, through the Tarantaise,
