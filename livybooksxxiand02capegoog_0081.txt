IN TROD UOTI ΟΝ. IV. lv

XS was common, not only in oompounds like

exspecto, bub in others like tamum, prooeeumm, and
inscriptions provo this in spite of the protenta of

the old grammariam, who regarded the ε aa noedless.
Assimilation of the last letter of the proposition
to the first of the verb with which it· is oompounded

began early, but. the inscriptions of the end of the
Republio have forme like adelmum-o, αᾰῖεσιαε, ado-ideo,
cauleyo, industrie, varied by more modern forms,
Tho grammarians favoured the general assimilation‚
and the prooem went fol-ward stendilys though modi-
fiod by pomonal caprice.
