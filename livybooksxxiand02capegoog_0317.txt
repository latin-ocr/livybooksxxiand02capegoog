ln altum, often used forthe sea, but seldom of a river.

5 12. de1ectis rect. Polyb. 111. 46 says that the Indian
drivers of these were drowned. He gives a lively picture os
them making their way across, each with its proboscis raised
alost above the suriace oi the water: the rest of his narrative
agrees with that of Livy, but he is clearer in the details, and
he rezerves the passage oi the elephants till Η. continues his
marc .

c. xxrx. g 1. trajiciuntur miserat. The sequence of
tenses is harsh. Fabri compares 11. 32. 1, dum hoec geruntur
in Samnio, jam omnes Etruriae populi ad arma ierant.

P, 31, g 2. atrocius quam pro numero. A form often used
by Livy, cf. 59. 9, major quam pro numero jactura, mvr. 10.

avertit In Polyb. there is a graphio picture of the
appearance of the Gauls at the camp of Η., but their arguments
seem addressed rather to the soldiers than their general, whose
mind was long made up to push on with all speed ¹for Italy,
especially as the season was advanoed. He sends his cavalry
down the river to hold the Romans in check while his elephante
crossed, and the infantry pushed on. Great as might be the
risk oi the passage through‘ the Alps, and Hannibal could
