general sense as the samtion of the senate, as the great govern-
ing power in the state. But it has also more specific senses.
1) In early times possibly the patrician members of the senate
the right of veto on any popular vote of the comitia3 their
sanction or patrum aucteritas was expressed by the formula
patres auctores fiunt. Their action was gradually confined to
questions of procedure and ceremonial usage, and by the Pub-
lilian law 338 Bo, their assent was required before the result
of the voting was known, 1. 17. 9, in incertum comitiorum even·
mm patres auctores fiunt, vm. 12. 16, ante initum suffr-mium.
(2) The aetion of the senate was subject to the veto 01 the
tribunes, but in such case of interierence, the resolution eonre
to, though it could not technically rank as a senatus comul-
uam, ¹ was protocolled, and quoted as a patrum auctoritas, as
the old sense of the term patres became saintet. Cf. Momm-
sen, Romische Forschungen, 233—249.
