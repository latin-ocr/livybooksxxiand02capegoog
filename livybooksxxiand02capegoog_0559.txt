’ The Times says :—“ The method of the work, so far as real instruction is
coneemed. is nearly au that could be desired. . . . Its eat merit. in addition to
its scientific arrangement and the attractive style so amiliar to the readers of
Green's Sltorjt History is that the facts are so presented as to compel the careful
student to think for himself. . . . The work may be read with pleasure and profit
by any( ne ; we trust that it will gradually find its way into the higher forms of
our schools. With this text-book as his guide. an intelligent teacher might make
geograpjtiy what it really is—one of the most interesting and widely-instructive
studies. -
