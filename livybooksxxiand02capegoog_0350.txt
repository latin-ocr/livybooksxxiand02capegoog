on the Ticinus (ἕως τοῦ πρώτου ποταμοῦ) and capture the 600
who were left behind to break the bridge by taking up the
planks (σανίδες) which stretched from pier to pier. Η. then
retires εἰς τάναντία παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν, that is higher up the
Po to find a suitable spot for crossing. Livy clearly implies
that H. crossed the Ticinus, and found the 600 engaged in
loosing the bridge of boats over the Po, which floated down
the stream (in secundam aquam) when its end was untied.

either army crossing the Trebia on its way to Placentia, and
the language oi both Livy and Polybius is general enough ior
any position in the neighbourhood. Niebuhr and others have
assumed that Scipio retreated to the east of Trebia, and that
Hannibal following him thither cut him off from his com-
munications with Rome. This view seems quite untenable for
the following reasons:
