“ MR. Mavon's work is beyond the reach of common litet-ary eompli-
ment. It is not only a commentary on Juvenal, but a mine os the most
valuable and interestin informanon on the history, socia! condition,
manners, and'beliefs of εἷο Roman world during the period of the early
Empire.''—·Pnor. N n‘rruzsm? m ‘ruz “Acaunum ’

‘⁴ Scarcely an valuable contribution-that has been hitherto made to the
interpretation o Juvenal will be sought in vain in this commentar-y . . . .
This excellent work meets the long felt want of a commentar-y to Juvenal
on a level with the demands of modern science.-·Paoi=·. annnu'inmtn
