pride. The classical historiam of later date, we
know, followed the same course, and still more cers
tainly‚ the chroniclers of the middle agee. For the
most part it would seem that they were quite content
in each part of their work with following one au-
thority alone, and that they transcribed freely from
it for a time, with little effert to balance or correct
from other sources, till at length another was taken
in its place, to be used for a while with equal free-
dom. But in the third decade of Livy the elementa

of the mosaic are much smaller than in the fourth ·

or fifth5 the passages are ehorter where the agreement
with Polybius is most marked, and yet in them the
variations are often too minute and numerous to be
consistent with such a method of procedure as that
whichhasbeen stated. If Livyhedhad thepages
of Polybius before him, he would probably have fol-
lowed him more closely, as the differences are often
not improvements.

5. The reasons given, as well as others which
arise from a detailed compar-ison between the two,
point to a common use of the same sources, rather
than to a direct bon-owing of the one historian from
the other. But they must have dealt with these in
different fashion, Livy keeping close to the early
narrative in its fuller form, while the edition which
Polybius gives is a summary and corrected one. It
rema-ins then to ascertain, if possible, the nature of
these common sources.
