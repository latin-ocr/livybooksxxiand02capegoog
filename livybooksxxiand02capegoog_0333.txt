NOTES. · XXI. c. xxxix. ξεί-Χῖ.. §2- 207
56. oppressisset, ‹surprisede used with the additional

, sense 01 arresting the movement.

§6- qua pars. Fabri gives other examples of the fre-
quent use of quic or qui ior uter.

P. 42', ς e. 00 mo, quoa... This is an merthought of
history. Livy forgets that H. had no great name as yet, and
that the consuls were not specially elected ior military skill,
except in times oi crisis.

5 9. inter se opinionem, ‘their estimato of each other,’ as
inter cc is often used for reciprocal action, as also alii alios, ac.
Sallust combines both. Cat. 22. 2, quo inter sc magis {liiii
forent alius alii tanti facinoris cmucii. Later writers, ' e
Tacitus, use invicem.

quod, renatus in Gallia.. Polyb. , 111. 60, says πρότερον ὀλίγαις
ἡμέραις, and makes Hannibal marvel at the promptitudo oi
Scipio, though at least a month must have elapsed, and the
Roman forces might have been brought round to meet H. at
the foot of the Alps before he had recruited his strength. It is
probable that 'in these phrases we may trace the influence of
the Scipionic circle in giving a iavourable colour to what was
really questionable generalship.

ς 10. occupant, ‘took the initiative by.’ cf. 1.. 14. 6,
occupabant bellum facere ,· Hor. Carm. 1. 14. 2, interdum rapere
occupat ,- still stronger mv, 30. 4, ipsi praeoccupaverunt serre. ι

educeret, so. exercitam. Often used absolutely by Livy in
this connexion.

c. xi.. ἓ 1. supersedissem 1. ‘I should have thought it
needless to harangue γοα] The speech of the general to his
Zptliclziggsszslffigllgaracteristio of Greek and Roman wariare, and of

g 2. v101ssent. Note the sudden change from the subi .
which expresses the speaker's thought to the ind. habui which
states only a matter oi fact.

comessionem... ‘In place of actual victory, 1 accepted as
a confession of defeat, the enemy’s fiight and refusal to engage.’
This is, oi course, a mere rhetorical boast.

5 3. meis auspiciis. In the technical system of Rome the
auspicia were taken by the legati or deputy commanders in the

legatos meis auspiciis aestas. Horace says, Garm. 1. 7. 27, with
less propriety, Teucro duce ct auspice Teucro. ι ·
