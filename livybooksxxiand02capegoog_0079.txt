IM’ROD UOTION. I V. liii

J. Gaeear, who eet the fashion of writing mximas, &o-
Quintil. 1. 7. 5 21.

Ε. 1. Livy wrote cibe, quase, end many in the
first century did likewiee, Quint. 1. 7. 524. So the
abl. of words like agilis, mamati· was written at the
end of the Republio with a final ο. The elder Pliny
proposed to write offilo of persons, ayili of things.
J. Oaesar deoided for the i, to distinguish abl. from
neut. nom„ but it did not definitely preveil till the
end of the oentury.

The form of the eoo. plur. gave critice much
trouble in the varieties of oie, ie, oe. It seems to
have. been settled that ie was the commoner ending
in words whose sing. nom.. end gen. ended in -ie, like
onmia, nm, or of nominativos in-erwith abl. in i, aa
acer, in words in m, re, like som, paam while words
in ae, ω more frequently assumed a plur. in σε. The
aocount of the grammatians that the gen. plurale in
ium were followed by eoo. plur. in is requires correo-
tion in this respect,

In the eoo. sing. there was also a. wavering be-

tween im and em, and the i prevailed only in Greek
worda, and a very few femininos.
Ι Ι (pingue). The broad ι’ eound was under the
Republio commonly written ei, which oeaeed in the
Augustan age, though grammariane reoognimd it
muoh later.

1 Ι. The doubling of i between bwo vowels was
preferred by Cicero, ae in oeiio, M adia, and inscriptione
