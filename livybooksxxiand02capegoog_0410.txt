5 10. resoluu- o.... ‘Unfasten the eables (whieh bound
*hesternos the shiptotho shore), anddrifttowardsthe
anchore ’ (which were let down from the prow faeing the sea
by aonam-alia). The MSS. read enelamur, which is ill
balanced by incidunt. W. reads evicti tenentur, which has
{itltlle to reeommend it, but is suggested by the teneat which
o οπο.

Ρ, 9⁷³5 ο. ιι. The [in] probably, as Madvig suggests, was
a copyist s error which grew out of the m in protentam.

g 2. quae non ant... The one set was not samm-thy, the
other had run aground and eould not be towed away.

§4- onnam. v, m. 22. 5.

5 5. maneta m. ‘which abutted on the walls! In forti·
fied towns a clear space was eommonly left. For use of iniuncto.
of. V. 7. 1, quum vineae tantum non iam iniuncta manibus cuent.

fi 6. Iona-antica must have been near Nova 0., according to
a passage from Pliny 19. 2. 30, aetimare quanto eit in usu
(spartum)...navium armamentis machinis aedificationum ...... ad
hos omnes mue quae sufficiant minus triyinta millia passuum in
latitudinem a litore Gau-thamin novoe minusque G in lonqitudi-
‘nem esee reperientur. .

spa-ru. sp. cepam. A natural grass which Pliny ealle
imus proprie aridi coli...hinc strata masticis eorum, hine
ignes facesque, hinc calceamina, et pastorum vestes. It was es·
peeially used for eordage on shipboard‚ in eicco praeferunt e
cannabi funes. Hence the name Spartarius Campus for the
neighbourhood of Carthago Nova.

ς 7. praelecta est ora. The MSS. reading is certainly eor.
rapt, proiectae oras or periectas. W. eon-eote it to proevecta
est oram (claude), but the change to the nent. pass. trane-
miesum is mueh more awkward after a verb like praevecta used
actively‚ and thereiore Madvig’s reading is to be preferred.

Ebusum. The largest of the Pi see islan'ds which lie
between the Baleares and the ooast of pain, now Iviza. Ibu-
sim=‘ pine islanda: Sehroder, p. 99.

§9- nauatam. ct. m. 21. 12.

5 10. prounde. Spain was not yet regarded as a pro.
vincia, though steps had been taken in that dneotion by the
commission given to Scipio, but as W. remarks Im is think-
ing of the later distinction of Hisp. citerior et ulterior.
