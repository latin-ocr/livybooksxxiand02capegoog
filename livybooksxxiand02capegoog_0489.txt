ROMAN RELIGION. 319

the State, and a College of Interpreters to unfold or to apply
their meaning (decemviri sacris faciundis). The frugal Senate
was chary indeed of such appeals, for experience had proved
‚ that the Sibyll sold her advice dearly, and never spared the
· public purse. Now she recommended a costly deputation to beg
some foreign deity to consent to house himself in Rome ς some-
times a new temple must be built to lodge more worthily a recent
visitor from Olympus; sometimes stately ceremonies might be
enough if they were only of the newest fashion, but in each
case we may note that some forward steps were taken in
naturalizing the Greek Pantheon on Italian soil. So one after
another the familiar forms of Greek mythology were recognized
in the religion of the State, sometimes thinly disguised in
Latin ‹li-ese, more often with names and attributes almost
unchanged, while the arrival· of each upon the scene was
marked by some enduring festival or shrine. To the same
source :may also be assigned the imposing ceremonies which
were for the most part of foreign growth.

The lectisternium, first heard of in the year 399 B. 0., (Livy
v. 13. 6,) but often repeated later, agreed with some features
of old Latin usage, but was specially connected with the
characteristic forms of the Apollo-worship (Theoxenia). All
was made ready for a costly banquet, and on each couch
(pulvinaria) were laid the symbols of the deities to be ap-
peased, while the viands from the feast, or offerings from< the
altars, were laid in solemn state before them. With these were
commonly connected supplicationes, a form of General Litany
or Proeessional Servios, in which young and old, citizens* and
country folks, moved in long lines through all the streete to
offer prayers in every temple where the pulvinaria were laid
out to view. These in their details, as also in the occa·
sions when we hear of them, remind us of the solemn Paeans
· by which Apollo was approached in times of thanksgiving or
intercession„ The Sibylline books did not fail also to en-
courage the system of vows (vota) which Roman usage had
long sanctioned. Often in the crisis of the battle, or some
time of urgent risk, magistrates had promised temples or
> costly offerings to their guardian powers, if only the tide of
danger would be rolled away. And so when prodigies were
rife, and panic spread, the advisere of the State appealed to
the efficacy of solemn vows. One such may seem to call for
special mention, as 'recorded in archaic language by the his-
torian of the 2nd Punic war. · ’-
· It had been an old Italian custom to promise to the gods
111 times of crisis the produce of the coming spring (ver sa-
emm), and the oustom may have dated from the days of
human sacrifice. For among the earliest stories of tribal
movements in Gentral Italy, we read that in days of famine,
