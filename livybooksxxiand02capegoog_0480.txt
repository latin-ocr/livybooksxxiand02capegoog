and over the· Little St Ber-nard to the valley of Aosta. In
favour of this route the following reasons may be urged.

1. 'l'he local features of the pass agree at least as well as

valley was a fertile one, and the native town which ey at-
taeked and pillaged may well have enriohed them with its

⁶ is steeper on the Italian side, and the dangers therefore of the
desoent would have been naturally greater. and in the ravine
below ‘la Tuile ’ there is a plaoe where the old snow might
long remain unmelted‚ and the road for some way is mueh
exposed to avalanohes. Here therefore Hannibal might find
the traek completely swept away, and be obliged to halt until
a new path was eut upon the mountain side. Though the
pass itself is comparatively low, the season was advaneed, and
fresh snow had lately fallen. 'l'he elimate was possibly more
severe in those days than at present, and the hardships seemed
more fearful to an army from the South.

2. The pass oalled afterwards the Graian Alp was one of
the best known and earliest used across the mountains. By it,
streame of invading Gauls had passed eenturies before. Its
neighbourhood was by far the most fertile of them all, and as
sueh best suited to supply an army on the march.

3. Its outlet was nearest to the country of the Gauls who
had sent to invite the Punic forces. Their envoys would
naturally know it best, and be most likely to guide the in·
vades-s on that course. Intraotable as the Romans found at a
latet date the tribe of the Salassi, who held the upper valley of
Aosta, there was no reason why they should obstruet the pas-
sage of the enemies of Rome, and the other tribes, Libui or
Lebeei, who were settled lower down, may well have followed
the poliey of the powerful Insubres, and sympathized in their
allianee with the sti-angers, Polybius therefore did not stay to
mention them, indeed from the island of the Allobroyes he
reeords no names until he makes Hannibal issue from the Alps
among the Insubres, the leading state of the Gallie confederaey
against Rome. He gives his reasons for this silenos, in the
general ignoranee that prevailed of the exact position of the
tribes and localities in question.

‚Livy wrote, however, at a later date, when the Alpine tribes
and names were far better known to the Italian publio. His
information therefore is more definite in ,¹1²⁸ss respect, and
