g 6. Id quum, &cn This is difficult, for Polyb. asserts that
Η. descended among the Insubres, as indeed it was likelythat⁴
he would do, since they and their allies had invited him to
cross into Italy. It may be that Livy only meant that the
annalists all spoke oi his attack on the Taurini as his first
movement in Italy, and as the Taurini were, strictly speak-
ing, a Ligurian not a Gallio tribe t{Strabo 1v. 6), possibly the
passage, whose reading is so doub nl, brought out the close

ambigi, quanam. No official account was likely to reach
Rome from the time when H. disappeared from Scipio’s sight,
till he was heard oi near the Po. The Alps were till long
after a terra incomita. and few like Polybius cared to travel
so far to gather up the local traditione.

P. 41. credere, the transition from the passive ambiyi to
an active is marked, but not unusual in Livy. In orat. directa
he would naturally say vulqo credant (sc. homines).

Poenlno. This was the pass of the Great St Bernard. Its
name is thought to be derived from the Celtic deity Penn
(Zeuss, die Deutschen, p. 5). Jupiter Poeninus was worshipped
on the summit, and the name has been found on' 30 ex voto
tablets which have been discovered near the top. It was also
called Mons Jovis, which survives in the names Mont-Joun
Plan-de-Joux which are still localized on the height. It was
by this pass that Livy, v. 35, brought the Boii and Lingones
into Italy in the 5th century no. The fanciiul derivation of
the name referred to in the text was an argument likely to
be urged in early times.

Cremonis lug. It is tempting to identify this with the

St Bernard, but the attempt rests on grounds oi etymology as
insecure as the case iust specified. It is probabis that only
one route was then known across the Alpes Graiae, that of
which Strabo speaks, 1v. 67, ‘the road from the Salassi parts

of montanos would be needless, as Madvig points out. The
