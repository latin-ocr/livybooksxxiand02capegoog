ROUTE 01²¹ HANNIBAL. 309

ἁπλῆν ρὖιν. It is moreover above the iunction with the
Duranee, ιο cross over which would have been a needless
,labour for the army.

The other place sugg ested near Beaucaire and Tarascon is
quite inconsistent with these data. In Livy there are no

definite statements on the subject to point to any special
place. After the passage os the Rhene however he say s that

Hannibal pushed on inland to avoid all contact with the Roman
army ,but his route was probabl decided on beforehand, and
he was guided by the Gauls, w o had invited him ιο Italy,
and whog would naturally lead him through the passes which
would bring him with most ease into their cantens. ·
Onwartlg to the Isere his route is certain, aiter that all is

matter os debate.
Our two authorities give a like account of the island enclosed

between the Rhene and the Isere-the insula Allobroyum of
later days—and of the contests between the native powers, in
which Hannibal took part. In Polybius we find besides the
following data: (1 ‘Hannibal having in ten days marched
800 stadia along t e river, began the ascent of the Alps) (2)
We hear that the chieftain with whom he sided in the quarrel
joined him ιιι his march, and that the barbarians were kept ιιι
clsietlalk m the plegn country alike from sear os the cavalry, and
o t e native ai .

'I'he words ‘ along the river,’ παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν, are not in
themselves definite. They have been taken to refer to the
Isere which was spoken oi not long before, and most critice
accordingly trace the route of Hannibal along one or other of
its banksg. But there can be little doubt that the‘ river’ oi
the whole narrative is the Rhene, and ιιι chapter 39 Polybius
expressly says that they kept near it to the entrance oi the
mountain pass. of course it is not to be supposed that ιι was
tracked in all its winding s, in the great bend ior example
which it makes at Lyons, but only that the general movement
was in the direction oi its stream. 'l'he country through which
the march would lie was such that the cavalry could be used
to good effect, while the leit bank of the Isere would not at all
meget this condition, and the right one would only partially
fulfil it. In both cases the mountain country comes ιιι sight
too soon, and the ascent (ἀναβολή) must have begun long be-
fore they had traversed 800 stadia of mad, or made their ten
days’ leisurely advance, ιιι constant sear of an attack.

Both these conditione are eomplied with by the route, which
following the Rhene up to Vienne, leaves it for a while ιιι its
great bend, and meets it once more at St Genix, and thence ιο
the pass os Mont du Chat where the ascent may be taken to
begin. 'I'hat point once reached the way would naturally lead
along the upper course oi the Isere, through the Tarantaise,
