ROMAN RELIGION. 317

oi Sacred Law. It knew the time-honoured methods by which
each Power Divine must be approached; it alone had access
to the ancient formularies of prayer, and all the nice rules of
sacrificial usage. None but the Pontiffs could be trusted
to draw up the Oalendar from year to year, 0οᾶ deter-
mine all the questions of casuistry which were suggested
by its 10010 0οᾶ feasts. For the worship of the Romans was
full of Pharisaic scruples. The slightest deviation from old
usage might vitiate a long round oi ceremonial forms, and the
whole service must begin 0110011, 01· 1110 5001000 Ρο1101· might
withhold its favour. In Cato's work 00 Agricultura we find
the author not content with 10100 oi close economy and
skilful farming3 he must also add a sort of Litargy or
Common Prayer·Book ior the use of the labourers upon the
farm, and the rubrics, extracted as they doubtless were from
the text-books oi the Pontiffs, help to show us how labori-
ously painstaking was the temper of Roman worship· But
with all its scrupulous care it could not but go wrong at
times, the Sacred College therefore was called 00 10 provide
a remedial machinery to soothe the anger of the offended
Powers. Was it a case merely oi some ceremonial neglect?
the mistake observed might be corrected, the faulty service
be repeated (instaurare), the compensation made for the
offence, 0οᾶ 1110 expiation (piaculum) was held to be com-
pleted. This was indeed no absolution for a guilty conscience,
ior the forms prescribed dealt only with the outer act, and
g'ave no promises oi peace to minds diseased.

Oiten however 00 human eye had noted what was wrong,
and it was left then for the gods to give their warnings
through unearthly signs (prodiyia). 11 the signs were given 00

house in order3 but if the place was public ground, then the

must accept the charge (suscipere), and take the neediul steps

through her officials (procurare prod.) to satisfy the gods 0οᾶ '

set the public mind at rest. Here agam was a wide field
opened ior the action of the Pontiffs. Others might shudder
only in their ignorant panio, but they must learn to recognize
the voice which spoke in portents, must turn over their old
books and profit by the inductione of the past, must be ready,
if they only could, 10 provide the state with their Authorized
Version of God’s Word to man. . For this purpose, after due
scrutiny of evidence, and rejection of the ill-attested quia sin-
