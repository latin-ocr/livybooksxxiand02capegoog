soldiers had taken the oath of obedience (sacramentum) singly‚
and had also pledged themselves voluntarily to their comrades
in the same decuria (of horse) or centuria (of scot) to be true
to each other. This pledge Mommsen believes to be a tra·
ditional custom oi old Italy, and to be indicated in passages
‚oi Livy 1x. 39. 3, x. 38. 2 where milites sacrati are spoken of.
This was now made obligatory.

5 3. iussu ...... abituros. These words are probably, as
Drakenborch suggests, a marginal comment on iure iurando,
&higini-ias slipped into the text. They seem needless in this ἱ

ad decuriandum. The MSS. have decuriatum and centuri·
atum, which are not known to occur elsewhere in this sense as
substantives. Some propose to omit the ad, and regard them
as supines, which would however be used in a passive sense..
In favour of the common reading it may be urged that Livy has
an especial fondness for verbals of the 4th decl. though centu-
riatus occurs only as the place of a centurio. There were
60 centuriae in the legion, and 30 decurioe oi the horse attached
to it.

ht} 4. ergo (ἔργῳ), archaic for cama, occurs chiefly in legal
p ses.

ς 6. ucessltum in 1t. 'I'his is probably a rhetorical use
of the charge which in early days ot· the struggles between the
two orders was so often urged by the tribunes against the
patrician rulers. Polybius ignores all these details of conflict oi
opinion at Rome.

g 8. verior quam gratier. For this repetition of the com·
paratim, cf. Cic. pro Milone, non timeam libentius hoec in illum
evomere videar quam verius. On the other hand the second is
omitted where it seems most needed in 1. 25. 14, eo maiore cum
ρατιάἰο, quo prope (for propius) metum res suerat. So Tac. Agr.
4, vehementius quam caute.

ς 9. quod ne. Valla proposed· quomedo for this reading 01
the best MS„ but qui would follow awkwardly and it seems
better to omit it. Cf. ιιι. 36. ξ», miranti quoe res.

togatus. An acute suggestion of Muretus for locatus os
