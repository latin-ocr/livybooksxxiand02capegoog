5 6. The MSS. have destinatum ...... consilio, ⁸ to the
struggle which he had long been planning,' possibly under-
standing certamen or id quod, but the constr. is harsh, andis
Α therefore corrected by Madvig. Sempronius neglected in this
battle the most elementary mles of war He fought with a
river in his rear, where defeat was ruin. He exposed his army
to attack while crossing in iull view of the enemy, and he
ignored the most obvious precautions as to food and cold. On
the other hand, Hannibal' s confidence in his own genius is
shown in letting the Roman army cross the river and form
upon the bank without taking advantage of their confusion.
His policy was not to defeat merely, but to annihilato the
enemy, and to prove to the world that he was mere than a
match ior the Romans on a fair field.
