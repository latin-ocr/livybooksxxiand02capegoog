soldiers’ strength among the friendly (huis, and then at their
request made war upon the tribe whose town bequeathed 'its
name, if not its site, to the Turin of modern times. It was

’ commonly forgotten that he had been invited to the Po by the

discontented Gauls, of whom the Insubres were the foremost
olan, and that their guides would naturally lead him first to
theiiistoown cantons, before they urged him to attack their
neig urs.

'l'o sum up then, it seems most probable, nay almost certain
that the route adopted by the Roman writer was that from
the Dromo to the Durance, and across the Mont Genbvre, the
Alpes Gottiae of the Roman Empire. It is also probable, though
less evident, that Polybius believed the army to have made a
longer circuit by the Rhene and the Tarentaise, across the
Graian Alps, or what is now the Little St Bernard. If the two
historians really are at issue, there is little doubt whose au·
thority should stand the higher, as the earlier had· higher
qualities as an historiari, and had made more special studies on

’ this subject. General probabilities also are in favour of the

easier, the lower, the better known, and the more favourably
placed of the two passes. If any however prefer to think that
the two accounts can be forced into agreement,-and most
critics hitherto have assumed that this is possible—then it
should be ,remembered that definite data in the form of proper
names occur only in the account of Livy, and the problem
must be to reconcile the earlier conditions in Polybius with the
outlet through the Mont Genevre. With the narrative of Livy
we may probabl connect the account of Varro above quoted,
which distinguisges the route of Hannibal from that across the
Graian Alps, and which may be due to reasoning from like
data. He carries Pompeius by a different road to Spain, as does
Sallust also in the fragment (Hist. 111. 3) where he puts into
that general’s mouth the words Per Alpes iter, aliud atque
Hannibal, nobis opportunius patefeci. -But the statements in
these cases are too vague to be critically handled.

It only remains now to deal with a third route—that over
the Mont cenis—which has found learned champions to ad·
vocate its claims. It should be stated at the outset that it is
not certainly referred to by any ancient author, and there is no
g'ood evidence that it was known or used before the eighth
century of our era when Pepin marched across it3 but this is
not of course conclusive, for Hannibal may have been guided
over a pass that was else scarcely known, and Latin writers

the natural construction of our authors fails to suit the theory,
at least in the form in which it is presented by its chief sup-
porters, M. Larauza, Dr Ukert and Μι- Ellis. These writers,
