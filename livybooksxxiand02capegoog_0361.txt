-NOTES. XXI. c. ι.. §3-0.1.1. 52.- 221

“ Ρ. 55. sicubi conserta. ‘Whenever a ship wa‘s laid
alongside of an enemy.¹

g 4. sua is used with reference to R„ which though not a

’ ³nominative is the real subject of the thought. ‘'I'he R. were

encouraged by their numbers.²

ξ 5. tres nomes. Note the small number of Carthagi
nians of good family who were serving on board3 the size oi
the ficet too was quite inadequate to its work, and indicates a
,growing neglect οἱ ,the navy at Carthage.

ἕ 6. liu-rorata· ι’Βιονο ιιι.’

usmetun. Some epithet must have dropped out here,
and this ¹one supplied by Madvig is as likely as any.

g 10. qmbusdam volentibus. Livy here seems to copy a
familiar Greek idiom, and to make volentibus a sort os dativus
comm. with fore. ‘Some would be well pleased with a revo-
lution. ’ Cf. Sall. Jug. 84. 3, neque plebei militia volenti
putabatur, Tae. Ann. 1. 59, ut quibusque bellum invitis aut
cupientibus erat. Yet the constr. is not found elsewhere in
Livy, audit is possible to take volentibus as an abl. abs„ and
the position oi the words agrees best with this view.

c. m. g 1. Melitam. Malta, 88 miles from the Sicilian
Pachynus. Strabo speaks only of the Maltese dogs in con-
nection with it. It was an early Phoenician settlement, and
the little island Gaulus close by has some remarkable remains
os Phoenician art. On the question whether ιι was the same
as the Melita of Acts xxviii. see J. Smith on the Voyage and
Shipwreck of St Paul, p. 160.

Ρ, 56, ς 2. sub corona ven-lerunt. ‘Were sold by auction)
nul. Ge1'1. vn. 4 explains the phrase as derived from the
garlandp ut on the head oi the slave offered for sale, οι· from
the circle of soldiers or bystanders (vulqi stante corona) gathered
round the captives. He prefers the former explanation. A
like phrase ιε sub hasta ven! from the spear, as a symbol of
the iperoe on which the slavery rested. This has lasted on in
the Subasta- :auctiori ιιι modern Italian.
