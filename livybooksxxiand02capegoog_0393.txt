ο. v. ξ 1.- satis, πῖ. Α· mmwhat grudging recognition oi

in re trepida. ‘ A state οἱ punio? Gi. 1. 27.·10, Tullus in rc
trepida duodecim vovit Salios.

ς 4. strepentium nav. This use of the gen. plur. oi the
partic, where we should put abstract substantives ⁶ triumph
and panic,' is oi frequent occurrence in Livy. Of. 17. 5,
flammas σξιέναηιυπε miraculo, xxm. 22. 7, fremitus indignantium.

⁴ 65 §8st imgtgtgm capere is a frequent phrase in Livy. cf. 11.
. , vm. . .

P, ¹79, 5 7. per principes. In the old form ol organizing
the legion the hastati formed the lst line, the principes the
2nd‚ as Livy describes at length, un. 8. The order is here

⁷ confused, as Livy is here writing probably from memory‚ with-

out documents‚ of a state oi things which had passed away.

antesignani. Men oi the frent line, whose siqua ‚mani-
pulorum were carried in the rear in battle, though in the van
when on the march. Thus Livy vm. 11. 4, stragem et ante
siqua etpost siqua factam.

cohorte. This is an unusual expression. After the time
oi Marius probably the old formation of the legion was super·
seded by that into 10 cohorte, but at this time the term was
only empl ed of the p‘raetoria cohors, or body-guard oi the
general, an oi the contingente of the allies. It is probably
used by Livy carelessly.

5 8. motum terrae. The authority oi Caelius is specislly
referred to ior this by CicerO, div. 1. 35, and it was probably
from him that Livy copied it.

c. vr. §2- Eum et seems to require another sentence of
like form to follow, but the constr. suddenly changes.

roboravit. orm 543.

g 3. noscitans. One oi the frequentatives often used by
our-author, though in this case seemingly less appropriate.

legiones. Livy commonly applies to other people the
distinctive terms oi the Roman civil and military systema.
